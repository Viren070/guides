# Guides

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The core of the website is stored in the docs folder. It contains the files written in Markdown (MDX) format which Docusaurus then turns into a website.

If you want to make changes to a specific page, fork the repository and locate the page within the docs folder. You can then make the changes and create a pull request


### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
