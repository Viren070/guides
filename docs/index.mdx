Welcome to a collection of comprehensive guides on various software. 
This website contains guides on software that I personally use and have found useful.  

The guides are split into categories, which can be found in the sidebar, and also below:

- [Gaming](category/gaming)
- [Streaming](category/streaming)
- [Reading](category/reading)

:::note
If you see the ‚è≥ icon next to a guide, it means that the guide is still in progress.
