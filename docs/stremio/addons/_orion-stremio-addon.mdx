[Orion](https://orionoid.com/referral/AD3JGNJRJFMRDNP9SEKHQKS9MGSAJDJN) is an indexer for torrent, usenet and hoster links. 

We will be using the [Orion Stremio Addon](https://github.com/gorlev/orion-stremio-addon) to access the links that Orion can provide.

If you are using Orion for free, you have a limit of 100 links per day. Their cheapest plan is $0.50 / month for 1000 daily links. 
You can check the pricing on their website.

To get started, we first need to create an account on Orion:
    1. Head over to [Orion](https://orionoid.com/referral/AD3JGNJRJFMRDNP9SEKHQKS9MGSAJDJN)
    2. Click `GET FREE ACCOUNT`
    3. Choose the registration type (email or username). I recommend username if you are testing as you can always add an email later.
    4. Fill in the username and password fields and click register.

Now that we have logged in, we need to configure our Orion account with any debrid services we are using.
1. Once you are logged in, head to your [account panel](https://panel.orionoid.com/)
2. Click on the `Account` menu on the navigation bar on the left of the screen.
3. Then click `Services` at the top.
4. Choose the debrid service you are using and click `Add Service`.

    Depending on your provider, you either need to authorise Orion as a device by following the on-screen instructions after clicking `Authorise` or you need to paste your API key in the box provided. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))

Finally, we need to configure the Orion Stremio Addon, head over to the [Orion Stremio Addon Configuration page](https://5a0d1888fa64-orion.baby-beamup.club/configure)
- `Orion API key` - You can find this on your [account panel](https://panel.orionoid.com/) in the main `Dash` page or `Account` -> `Profile` -> `API Key`.
- `Link limit per search` - This is the maximum number of links that will be displayed per search.

    Depending on your plan, you may want to change this to lower values as each link that is displayed when you click on a movie/show counts towards your daily limit. I set mine to 10 (this means I can search for 10 movies/shows before I reach my daily limit on the free plan)

- `Sorting` - The sorting options available here are much more varied compared to other addons. You can experiment with these to see which one you prefer. I still choose `Sort by file size`.
- `Video Quality` - I leave the default selection of options (4K (HD), 1080p (HD), 720p (HD), SD). The SCR means Screener and CAM means Camera. I exclude these as they are of lower quality.

The next step is to click `Install`. This will open Stremio and prompt you to install the addon. Click Install again and the addon will be installed.

You can also click the clipboard button to copy the installation URL and paste it into the Stremio addon search bar or the add addon menu on Stremio Web.
