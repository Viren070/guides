You can either use a standalone server with the Stremio Service or use the server that is built-in to the desktop application.
If you are planning on using Stremio Web only, then I recommend using the standalone server.

To get started, first ensure that one of the two is downloaded and installed .

1.  Download the standalone [Stremio Service](https://www.stremio.com/download-service) or the [Stremio Desktop](https://www.stremio.com/download) application.
2.  Run the setup and then launch the application.
    :::note
    If you are using Stremio Service, you can see if it is running by checking the system tray.
    :::
3.  Open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/)
4.  Go to Settings
5.  Click on the Streaming section, you should see this:

        ![stremio service settings](/img/stremio/service_settings.png)

    :::tip
    If it shows the Status as error, try disabling any adblockers/tracking blockers you have enabled.
    On Brave, it will not work without disabling Brave Shields.

    You may need to also add an exception for the Stremio service in your firewall settings.
    :::

6.  The Stremio service has now been correctly set up. However, you can only access it on the same device.
    To access it from another device (in the same network) follow the next steps:

7.  Set the Streaming HTTPS endpoint to your local IP address (this option should appear as a dropdown).
8.  Then copy the Remote URL and paste it into your other device's Stremio settings for the streaming server URL.

The Stremio service is now set up and can be accessed from another device.
