# Template

This guide will show you how to use my template Docker Compose file to quickly deploy services.

Having followed my previous guides, you should have a basic understanding of how to deploy services with Docker Compose.
This section will focus on using [my template `compose.yaml`](https://github.com/Viren070/docker-compose-vps-template).

## What is it for?

The "template" makes use of a Docker Compose project and its [include](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/include/) feature to
allow you to easily use and maintain a large number of services.

Each individual app has its own `compose.yaml` file, which will usually have its own `.env` file for configuration,
and then the main `compose.yaml` file **includes** all of them.

The `.env` files handle most of the configuration for the services, which means you usually don't have to ever edit the `compose.yaml` file itself,
just the documented `.env` files.

This means that when using the compose project, it counts as one single file with all the services in it. This makes it easy
to reference other containers, and not having to deal with multiple networks, etc.

This `compose.yaml` uses [Traefik](https://traefik.io) as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the correct service.
All our services are put behind Traefik, which allows us to access all services on the same port (80/443) and Traefik will route the traffic to the correct service.
This means that port 80 and 443 are the only ports that need to be open on your server.

We use Authelia as an authentication service, which allows us to protect our services. Authelia is not applied
to every single service, but only to the ones that require authentication. This is done through Traefik labels.
I will discuss how to add Authelia to a service later on.

A quick summary of what is included in this template is:

- Default server management services
- Stremio related services
- Debrid media server services
- Seanime
- Minecraft server
- Plausible analytics
- Vaultwarden
- SearXNG
- Zipline

<details>
<summary>What is the full list of services that are available in the template?</summary>
  <div>

    [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) is included as our reverse proxy. It is used to route traffic to the correct service. It means that you can access all services on the same port (80/443) and Traefik will route the traffic to the correct service.
    It also allows for automatic SSL certificate generation using Let's Encrypt, which is required for Stremio addons as Stremio requires HTTPS to install addons.

    Authelia is included for authentication.

    To help with managing the server, the following services are included:

    - [Dozzle](https://github.com/amir20/dozzle) - A simple real time log viewer for docker containers with a web based UI.
    - [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) - Automatically update your Docker containers to the latest version.
    - [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) - A self-hosted monitoring tool for your services.
      - This is useful for monitoring the status of your services and receiving alerts. You do have to set up your services manually, but this can be done through the web interface.
    - [Dash.](https://github.com/MauriceNino/dashdot) - A simple dashboard to monitor your server.
    - [Honey](https://github.com/dani3l0/honey) - Beautiful, customisable, startpage for your server to access all your services.
    - [Flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame) - A simple startpage, requiring minimal setup, for your server.

    I have provided 2 startpages, Honey and Flame. You can choose which one you want to use. You can also use both if you want.
    The reason being that Honey requires a bit more setup, as you need to edit honey's config.json file and replace the urls with your own.
    I have provided my template which has all the images, so its not too hard to do. Flame is a bit more simple and requires no setup.
    But, it also has no images and you would have to provide that yourself for each service. Honey, IMO, looks far better.

        - [Stremio Server](https://github.com/Stremio/server-docker)
          - This is the official Stremio server docker image. This handles the downloading and transcoding of streams. This is useful if you use Stremio on devices
            that don't have a server bundled with it, like on iOS on Stremio Web. It will allow you to stream torrents on those devices. Debrid streams may not be transcoded on all clients, however.

## Customising the template

The template is designed to be easily customisable. You can add your own services, remove services, and modify the configuration of the services.

My compose.yaml makes use of profiles to make it easier to deploy only specific services.
Each individual service has its own profile, so seanime has a profile called `seanime`, and so on.

There are also profiles that are a group of services that are related to each other. For example, the `stremio` profile contains services that are related to Stremio.

The grouped profiles are as follows:

- `stremio`
- `debrid_media_server`
- `indexers` (includes Prowlarr, Jackett, NZBHydra2)
- `all`

The individual profiles are simply the names of the folder names in the `apps` directory.

There are also services that are not specified in a profile. These services can be referred to as the **default** services.
They will always be included in the deployment, no matter what profiles you choose or don't choose.

The default profile contains the following services:

- Traefik, Authelia, Flame, Dash., Honey, Uptime Kuma, Watchtower, Dozzle.

After you have chosen which profiles you are going to use, keep them in mind, as you will now need to fill in
the .env file with the necessary environment variables.

Other than choosing the profiles, you could also modify the root `compose.yaml` file and remove a compose.yaml from the include list.
e.g. If you wanted to use the stremio profile, but not the TMDB addon, you could remove the `- tmdb-addon/compose.yaml` line under the `include:` section.

## Setup

1. First, you should ensure Docker is installed per https://get.docker.com/ (If you followed my previous guides, you should already have Docker installed).

2. Next, you should make sure both port 80 and 443 are open on your server. This is required for Traefik to work correctly.
   :::tip
   If you are using Oracle Cloud, you can follow [these steps](/selfhosting/oracle#opening-ports) to open the ports.
   :::

3. Then, connect to your server on a terminal. Typically using the command below, or if you created a Windows Terminal profile, you can use that.

   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@your-server-ip
   ```

4. Next, you should clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd /opt
   git clone https://github.com/Viren070/docker-compose-vps-template.git docker
   ```

   This will clone the repository into a directory called `docker` located in `/opt/docker`.

5. Next, you should navigate into the directory that contains the `compose.yaml` file.

   ```bash
   cd docker/apps
   ```

6. You can now confirm that the files have been downloaded by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ls -a
   ```

   You should see a list of folders, an .env file, and a `compose.yaml` file.

7. Next, you should edit the `.env` files to fill in the necessary environment variables. Start off with the root `.env` file.

   There are many ways to fill these values in, you could:

   - use a CLI text editor like `nano` or `vim` to edit the file directly through the terminal.
     ```
     nano .env
     ```
   - Use VS Code to edit the file directly on the server using the `Remote - SSH` extension. (**recommended**)

     1. Install the `Remote - SSH` extension in VS Code.
     2. Open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`.
     3. Enter the SSH connection string for your server (e.g. `ubuntu@your-server-ip`).
     4. Once connected, navigate to the `/opt/docker/apps` directory (`Ctrl + K` + `Ctrl + O` / `File` > `Open Folder...`).
     5. You will be able to see all the files and folders in the sidebar. Edit the `.env` files for each service from here
        by simply clicking on them and then editing them. You can also use the terminal in VS Code to run commands on the server.
        Make sure to save the files after editing them. (`Ctrl + S` / `File` > `Save`).

   - Edit all the files locally (so clone the repository to your local machine first) using your preferred method
     and then upload them to your server using `scp`.

   :::info
   You should only fill in the environment variables for the services you are going to deploy.
   If you add a profile, the full set of environment variables for each app under that profile will be required.
   :::

8. Now, you should ensure that for every hostname you set in the `.env` files, you have a DNS `A record` handling it pointing it to your servers **public IP**.
   :::warning
   If you are using Cloudflare, you should disable the proxy (orange cloud) for the DNS record. This is because Traefik needs to connect directly to your server.
   :::
   :::tip
   You can create a wildcard DNS by using an A record with `*` as the subdomain. e.g. `*.yourdomain.com`. This will allow you to use any subdomain while only
   needing to create one DNS record.

   However, this can cause issues and will cause any subdomain to be routed to your server.
   For example, if you're running a minecraft server, it will mean that any subdomain will be routed to your server.
   :::

9. After you have filled in the environment variables, you can now deploy the services. You should make sure you defined the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variables
   as this will determine which profiles are started. If you did not set it, then only the services in the default profile would be started.

   Then, you can run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

- You can also specify the profiles through the `--profile` flag, e.g.
  ```bash
  docker compose --profile stremio --profile seanime up -d
  ```

11. After running the command, it may take some time for the services to start up. Once it is done, you should be able to access them at the hostnames you
    set in the `.env` file.

## Modifying the profiles

You may want to omit some services from the profiles, this is possible by removing the profile from the service in the `compose.yaml` file.

<details>
<summary>I want to use the stremio profile but don't want the TMDB Addon</summary>
  <div>
  
    Within the `compose.yaml` file, you can remove the `stremio` profile from the `tmdb-addon` and `tmdb-addon_mongo` services.
    Remove the highlighted lines below:

      ```yaml title="/opt/docker/apps/tmdb-addon/compose.yaml"
      services:
        tmdb-addon:
          image: viren070/tmdb-addon:latest
          container_name: tmdb-addon
          restart: unless-stopped
          expose:
            - 3232
          environment:
            - PORT=3232
            - TMDB_API=${TMDB_API_KEY?}  # https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
            - FANART_API=${FANART_API_KEY?}  # https://fanart.tv/get-an-api-key/
            - HOST_NAME=${TMDB_ADDON_HOSTNAME?}
            - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/tmdb
            - META_TTL=604800  # 1 week
            - CATALOG_TTL=86400  # 1 day
            - NO_CACHE=false  # Enable cache, set to true to disable
          labels:
            - "traefik.enable=true"
            - "traefik.http.routers.tmdb.rule=Host(`${TMDB_ADDON_HOSTNAME?}`)"
            - "traefik.http.routers.tmdb.entrypoints=websecure"
            - "traefik.http.routers.tmdb.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
            - "traefik.http.services.tmdb.loadbalancer.server.port=3232"
            - "flame.type=app"
            - "flame.name=TMDB Addon"
            - "flame.url=https://${TMDB_ADDON_HOSTNAME?}"
          depends_on:
            tmdb-addon_mongo:
              condition: service_healthy
          profiles:
            - tmdb-addon
            // highlight-next-line
            - stremio
            - all

        tmdb-addon_mongo:
          image: mongo:latest
          container_name: tmdb-addon_mongo
          restart: unless-stopped
          volumes:
            - ${DOCKER_DATA_DIR}/tmdb-addon/db:/data/db
          healthcheck:
            test: echo 'db.runCommand("ping").ok' | mongosh localhost:27017/test --quiet
            interval: 10s
            timeout: 10s
            retries: 5
            start_period: 40s
          profiles:
            - tmdb-addon
            // highlight-next-line
            - stremio
            - all

        ```

      You could instead remove the include line from the root `compose.yaml` for the `tmdb-addon` service.
      This would mean that the service would not be included in the deployment at all.
      Adding the 'tmdb-addon' profile to the `DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable would also not work unless this line is added back.

      ```yaml title="/opt/docker/apps/compose.yaml"


      include:
        ...
        - tautulli/compose.yaml
        // highlight-next-line
        - tmdb-addon/compose.yaml
        - torbox-manager/compose.yaml
        ...
      networks:
        default:
          name: ${DOCKER_NETWORK:-aio_default}
          external: ${DOCKER_NETWORK_EXTERNAL:-false}

      ```

  </div>
</details>

## Adding Authelia to a service

As mentioned before, Authelia is included in the template, but not every service is protected by it.
This is because some services already have their own authentication system.

For example, Uptime Kuma has its own authentication system, so it doesn't need Authelia.
But, you may want to add Authelia anyways, so I will show you how to do that.

You will have to edit the `compose.yaml` file for the service you want to add Authelia to.

For this example, we will use Uptime Kuma. You simply need to add one line defining the Authelia middleware to the router.

```yaml title="/opt/docker/apps/uptime-kuma/compose.yaml"
services:
  uptime-kuma:
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:latest
    container_name: kuma
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PUID: ${PUID}
      PGID: ${PGID}
    expose:
      - 3001
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.uptime-kuma.rule=Host(`${UPTIME_KUMA_HOSTNAME?}`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.uptime-kuma.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.uptime-kuma.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
      // highlight-next-line
      - "traefik.http.routers.uptime-kuma.middlewares=authelia@docker"
      - "flame.type=app"
      - "flame.name=Uptime Kuma"
      - "flame.url=https://${UPTIME_KUMA_HOSTNAME?}"
    volumes:
      - ${DOCKER_DATA_DIR}/uptime-kuma:/app/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

## Removing built-in authentication from the \*arrs

The \*arrs have their own authentication system, which is enabled by default.
Since these services are behind Authelia, you may want to disable the in-built authentication system.
This cannot be done through the web UI, you must edit the config files.

To make this easier, you can simply run this command to disable the authentication system. This depends on the current Authentication being set to `None`.
i.e. You must run this before setting up the \*arrs.

```bash
find /opt/docker/data -type f -name "*.xml" -exec sed -i 's|<AuthenticationMethod>None</AuthenticationMethod>|<AuthenticationMethod>External</AuthenticationMethod>|g' {} +
```

- This will find all the XML files in the `/opt/docker/data` directory and replace the `None` authentication method with `External`.
