# Site 

This site contains a collection of guides for piracy related stuff. I have collated the information available in these guides from various sources. The credits page for each guide will list the sources I used.

This sites source code is available on GitHub. You are encouraged to improve the guide by making suggestions or corrections through pull requests.
