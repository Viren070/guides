MediaFusion is a universal stremio addon that provides a variety of content (including Live TV and Sports)

Check the [features section](https://github.com/mhdzumair/MediaFusion?tab=readme-ov-file#-features) of their GitHub page to see all that the addon has to offer.

This addon can be [selfhosted](https://github.com/mhdzumair/MediaFusion?tab=readme-ov-file#-local-add-on-deployment) or [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/mediafusion/).

I will go through the setup using the free, public ElfHosted instance. If you don't want to selfhost but want more customisation, you can pay for your own instance on ElfHosted.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com/configure):

- `Streaming Provider` - Here you can choose whether to use direct torrent or a debrid service or another provider. Select what you are using and then fill in the details below.
                            
    - To authorise MediaFusion to your debrid service, you can either click `Authorise`, if present, or otherwise, you can enter your API key in the `Token` field (Struggling to find the API key? [Click here](faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))

- **Catalog Configuration:**

    Here you can choose which content is available to you through MediaFusion. Simply select the content you want to see. I will provide some notes on specific options below.
    - `Prowlarr Streams` - This will provide you with streams from Prowlarr. You should enable this to get more streams.
    - `Torrentio Streams` - This will provide streams from either Torrentio or Knightcrawler. On the public ElfHosted instance, it is configured to use KnightCrawler. 
                            Although you will get more streams by enabling this, if you already have Torrentio installed, you may want to disable this to avoid duplicate streams.
    - `Zilean DMM Streams` - This will provide you with streams obtained through [Zilean](https://github.com/iPromKnight/zilean), a [DMM](extras/debrid-media-manager) scraper. You should enable this to get more streams.
    - `Contribution Streams` - Enabling this provide a stream on movies and shows that allow you to upload torrent files or magnet links to MediaFusion for the community.
                                You can read more about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1cwaqh8/comment/l4w1bw1/)
    - `Live Sport Events` - This will provide catalogues with ongoing live sports events. You should enable this if you want to watch live sports.
    - `Live TV` - This will provide catalogues with live TV channels. You should enable this if you want to watch live TV.
    - `Football`, `Other Sports`, etc. - I believe these will provide catalogues with replays of different sports.
    - `Provider Watchlist Catalog` - This will provide a catalog displaying all the files you have watched using the provider. I leave this unchecked as it is unnecessary clutter.
    - `Show Catalogs in Stremio (& Kodi)` - This will show the catalogues in Stremio. I leave this checked as I want to see the catalogues for the content I have enabled.
    
- **Parental Guides:** 
    
    This will allow you to control the content that is displayed. You can filter by certification levels and nudity levels. 
    - `Certification Levels` - The different options you select are the type of content that will not appear in the catalogues. For example, if you select `Adult`, then any content with an adult certification will not appear in the catalogues.
                               If you want to see all content, then you can select `Disable`.
    - `Nudity` - The optons you select will control the level of nudity in the content that appears in the catalogues. For example, if you select `Severe`, then any content with a severe nudity level will not appear in the catalogues.
                 If you want to see all content, then you can select `Disable`.


    :::info
    The certification levels and nudity levels are based on the information provided by IMDB. 
    Sometimes, the data on IMDB can be provided by the community.
    Therefore, the accuracy of the information may not always be accurate. 

    To see what exact certification levels are covered by each option, see [here](https://github.com/mhdzumair/MediaFusion/blob/876cfd81760f34c9c1cbb48f5814299b1ef2d7de/utils/const.py#L188)

- **Streaming Preferences**:
    - `Streaming Resolutions` - Here you can choose which resolutions you want to see. I leave all resolutions selected, however, if you have a slow internet connection or your device can't handle 4K content, you may want to deselect 4K.
    - `Quality Filter` - Here you can choose the types of quality you want to see. I uncheck CAM/Screener as I don't want to see CAM content. 
    - `Set File Size Filter` - Here you can use a max file size. I leave this at the end for an unlimited file size as I want to see all the streams available.
    - `Sorting Priority` - Here you can choose the order in which the streams are displayed. I choose `Cached`, `Resolution`, `Quality`, `Size` - in that order. If you are not using a debrid service, then do `Resolution` and `Seeders`. This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
        - `Language` - If you choose to sort by languages, you can control the languages that show in the results and apply a sorting priority to them. 
                       Only the languages you select will show in the results. Whichever language is at the top of the list will be the first language to show in the results.
    - `Max Streams per Resolution` - Here you can choose the maximum number of streams per resolution. I set this to 50 to get a large number of streams. 
    - `Torrent Stream Display option` - Here you can choose how the torrent streams are displayed. I choose `Show parsed data`. Although there is a small chance that the parsed data is incorrect, it is usually correct and it is easier to read than the other options.

- **External Services Configuration:**
    - **MediaFlow**: This is a service that allows you to proxy your streams through a server. You will have to either self host your MediaFlow Proxy server or pay for an instance at [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/mediaflow-proxy/). 
        You can read more about MediaFlows features and instructions on setting it up [on its GitHub page](https://github.com/mhdzumair/mediaflow-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#mediaflow-proxy).

        By using MediaFlow, you can:
        - Gain access to DRM protected live streams 
        - Use MediaFusion configured with the same debrid provider across different IP addresses. In simple terms, you can use the debrid account from different locations simulateneously (through MediaFusion). As all the streams are proxied through the same server, it will appear as if they are all coming from the same IP address / location.
    
    - **RPDB**: This service allows you to have posters with ratings on them. To use this, you will need to obtain an API key. There is a free tier available. To obtain your API key, see [this question in the FAQ](faq#how-do-i-obtain-a-rpdb-api-key)

Now that MediaFusion has been configured, click `Install in Stremio`. This will open Stremio and prompt you to install the addon. Click Install again and the addon will be installed.

You can also click `Share Manifest URL` and copy the URL into either the Stremio addon search bar or the add addon menu on Stremio Web.
