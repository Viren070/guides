# FAQ

This FAQ will mostly repeat what has already been said but provide the answers in a more accessible form 

## Debrid/VPN Questions

### Is a Debrid Service required?

No. Depending on your circumstances, Stremio and Torrentio without a Debrid service may work fine and 4K content may still stream without buffering. 

However, torrenting carries a legal risk and if this is an issue for you, a debrid service is recommended. 

Furthermore, torrenting relies on seeders being available constantly and you are limited by the upload seed of the seeders. 
With a Debrid Service, this issue is solved as the torrent is downloaded to the Debrid services' high speed servers. 
You can then stream content from their servers at high speeds. (The speed is still limited by your own internet connection)

### Do I need a VPN?

If you are using a debrid service, a VPN is NOT required. 

For HTTP addons, a VPN is not required. 
However, if you are using a torrent addon such as Torrentio then a VPN or a Debrid service might be required.

This depends on the laws in your country. If your country is strict on torrenting, then a VPN or a Debrid service is recommended. 
Otherwise, you can use Stremio without a VPN or a Debrid service.

However, a Debrid service is usually the better option as it is usually cheaper and provides a smoother experience on Stremio and a debrid service can also be used to download other torrents.

### Can you have a recurring payment with Real Debrid?

On Real Debrid, there are no recurring payments. You will have to set a reminder to renew your subscription. You can always add more days to your subscription before it expires. 

Other debrid providers, such as AllDebrid, do have recurring payments based on a monthly subscription.

### How do I know if I am in an optimal location for a Debrid service?

You can check the speed of your connection to the Debrid service by using the speedtest on the Debrid service's website.

You can find the speed tests [here](#where-can-i-find-the-speed-tests-for-debrid-services).

For other Debrid services, you can find the speedtest on their website.

### Can I use a Debrid service on multiple devices?

Yes. A debrid service can be used from an unlimited number of devices. **However, you cannot use the service from more than one public IP address at a time.** 

This means that you can use the service on multiple devices within your home network but you cannot use the service on a device outside of your home network while another device is using the service at home.

Premiumize is an exception to this rule as it can be used from unlimited devices and unlimited IP addresses at the same time.

### Can I use a Debrid service with a VPN?

Yes, but it is not recommended. A debrid service is enough to protect you from legal trouble and a VPN can limit your speed.

You must also ensure that no one else on your home network is using the Debrid service at the same time as this would be considered as using the service from multiple IP addresses at the same time.

### Where can I find the speed tests for Debrid services?

Here, you can find the links to the speed tests for different Debrid services. These speed tests will give you an idea of the speed you can expect when streaming through these services.
:::warning
You may need to be logged in to access these pages. If you get any errors attempting to access these pages, try logging in to the Debrid service first, then clicking the link again.
:::
- [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/speedtest)
- [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/speedtest)
- [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/speedtest)
- [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.fr/webapp/speedtest)
- [put.io](https://app.put.io/settings/route) 

For offcloud, there is no speedtest available, however you can test the speed by checking each proxy manually and attempting to download a file. 
This does require you to have a premium account.

For other Debrid services, you can try to find the speed test on their website.

You can also use [SamKnows](https://www.samknows.com/realspeed) to test your own internet speed. This will let you know if a debrid service is limiting your speed.

:::info
You will have to uninstall the old version of the addon as you would otherwise have two versions of the addon installed.
:::
### Where can I find more addons?

Through the Community addons tab in the Addons menu of the Stremio app or the [community hosted addon list](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/)

### Is [insert addon here] down?

Use this [website](https://status.elfhosted.com/) from ElfHosted to check the status of various addons. You can also check the [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/) subreddit or the [r/StremioAddons Discord](https://discord.gg/zNRf6YF) for more information.

### Is there a way to change the order of the addons without reinstalling them?

Yes. You can use the [Stremio Addon Manager](extras#addon-manager) to change the order of your addons without reinstalling them.

## Stremio questions 

### Will I have to repeat the setup process on all of my devices?

No. Your account and its addons are stored on Stremio's servers. Meaning that it is all in the cloud. As long as you sign in to the same account on a different device, it will sync the addons that are linked with your account and you do not need to repeat the setup process.

### My device was not listed in the supported devices list. Can I still use it?

Yes. Through [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com), any device can use Stremio as long as you log in your account.

### Can I use Stremio on my Smart TV?

Yes. Stremio will run on any android based smart TV. It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. 
Stremio is also available on LG WebOS (2020+ models only) and Samsung Tizen (2019+ models only). You can download it from the respective app stores.

### Can I use Stremio on my iPhone or iPad?

Yes. Although a fully featured Stremio app is not available on iOS, you can add the Stremio Web app to your home screen. You will need to set an external player such as Outplayer or VLC. Follow this [blog post from Stremio](https://blog.stremio.com/using-stremio-web-on-iphone-ipad/) for more information.
:::info
Keep in mind that the Stremio Web app on iOS is unable to handle torrent playback. For this reason, you will have to use HTTP addons or use a Debrid service to stream torrent files through HTTP.

### What streaming device should I use for Stremio?

The Chromecast 4K with Google TV, Fire TV Stick 4K, or the ONN 4K Box Pro are the best devices in terms of value for money. 

The ONN is only available in America from Walmart but it is the best value so it is highly recommended. 

The Amazon Fire TV Sticks are becoming more and more locked down and many have run into issues with them. 
They will be moving from an Android based OS to a custom OS and this will make sideloading Stremio impossible. 
However, currently, it is still a good option if you are not in America. 

The Chromecast 4K with Google TV is the most customisable and offers the best experience. 

However, the most powerful device you can use is the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro. It is the most expensive but it is the most powerful. Although it is old, it still is a good choice. 
You may also consider the Fire Cube. 

In my personal opinion (I recommend researching this yourself): 
- the best device in terms of value for money is the ONN 4K Box Pro if you are in America or the cheapest out of the Fire Stick 4K and Chromecast 4K if you are not in America.
- the best device in terms of performance is the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro.

### Can I use Stremio on my Apple TV or Roku?

No. Stremio is not available on Apple TV or Roku.

### Can I use Stremio on my Rasberry Pi? 

Yes. The Stremio team have released Stremio OS  for the Rasberry Pi 4 and 5 that has Stremio pre-installed. 
You can find the download link and instructions [here](https://blog.stremio.com/stremio-os-is-now-available-for-raspberry-pi-5-4/)

### How do I change the default player?

The instructions are different depending on the device you are using. I'm not sure on the instructions for every device but they should be something similar. 
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="web" label="Stremio Web" default>
    1. Go to the settings menu
    2. Click on the player tab
    3. Scroll down to the advanced section and find the `Play in external player` option
    4. Click on the dropdown menu and select the player you want to use

    2. There should be an option saying `Watch on [player name]`
    3. Click on this and the video should open in the player you selected
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android" label="Android">
    1. Within the player, there is a button that says `Play in external player`

    <Admonition type="info">

    </Admonition>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Can I download a stream from Stremio?

Yes. You can download a video by clicking the 3 dots within the player and then clicking `Download this video`.

You can also use [Stremio Downloader](extras#stremio-downloader).

### Is there a watch together feature? 
Although there is no official watch together feature, you can use several solutions: 
- [Peario](https://peario.xyz/) is a watch together service that works with Stremio specifically. Scroll down to the `Bonus: Movies are better with popcorn... and friends` section of the [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/17833ms/stremio_all_you_need_to_know/) for more information.
:::danger
Peario simply shares the streaming link that you click on with your friends. 
This means that if you are **using a Debrid service**, your friends will count as an additional IP address and you can get your account **terminated**. (This is not the case for Premiumize)
This has been confirmed by the developer in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/tymmesyde/peario-client/issues/67)
:::
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) has a screen sharing feature that can be used to watch content together. However, you will be limited to the quality of the stream that Discord can handle which is 720p@30fps or 4k@60fps for Nitro users.
:::info 
You can use client modifications such as [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) or [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) to increase the quality of the stream without having to pay for Nitro
:::
- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/) is a screen sharing service that can be used to watch content together. It is not limited by the quality of the stream that Discord is limited to.

### Can I use my own subtitles?

Yes. Drag your subtitle file into the player and it should play with the video. You can also use the MSubtitles addon to use your own subtitles.

### Can I make my own addon for Stremio?

Yes. The [Stremio Addon SDK](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/) can be used to develop addons with Node.js. 
Addons can also be developed with any other language that supports creating a HTTP server. Here are some [examples](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/blob/ff10a5a66ff6a592d6145baba117515041aa33ab/docs/examples.md)

### Can I use Stremio to watch Live TV?

Stremio does support live streams. However, its its interface is not designed for this. However:
- MediaFusion does provide live streams
- The [xtremio addon](https://xtremio.elfhosted.com/configure) can be used to stream content from your paid IPTV subscription.
