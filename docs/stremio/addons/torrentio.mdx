<h3>Description</h3>

[Torrentio](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper) is a torrent search addon that scrapes public trackers. (For a in depth explanation of how Torrentio works, see [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/19fmjlp/comment/kjlnwru/))

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To begin, head over to [Torrentio's config page](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) to manage the addon.

Torrentio has a lot of options to customise your experience. I will go through each option explaining what it does and list my preferences and why.

![Torrentio Configuration](/img/stremio/torrentio_setup.png)

- `Providers`: I have them all checked. This is to maximise results. You can uncheck foreign providers to remove potential foreign language results.
- `Sorting`: By quality then size. If you are not using a debrid service, then do By quality then seeders . This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
- `Priority foreign language`: The language you set here will be shown first in the results. You can do this if you prefer a specific language. I leave this as None as I want English audio. 
- `Exclude qualities`: This option allows you to remove certain qualities from the search results. I exclude *Screener* and *CAM* sources. If you have slower internet or your devices aren't capable of playing 4K content, you may want to exclude 4K sources.
- `Max results per quality`: This option will limit the number of results shown for each quality. I leave this blank to obtain all results.
- `Video size limit`: This option will limit the size of the video. If your internet or device is not capable of streaming large files, you may want to set a limit. I leave this blank.
- `Debrid provider`: Choose your Debrid provider if you are using one. If not, skip the rest of the options.
    :::tip
    If you are using more than one debrid provider, you can choose a different provider in the same configuration and when you install the addon, you will get results from each provider you have chosen and given an API key for.

    Torrentio will query the first debrid provider you choose and only if it doesn't find the torrent there will it query the next provider.
    :::
- `API Key`: Click *here*. This link will take you to your debrid provider's website where you can obtain your API key. Copy that and paste it here. (Struggling to find the API key? [click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- `Debrid options`
    - `Don't show download to debrid`: These links will be displayed with a Debrid Download] in front of them. 
        These are torrents that were found but not downloaded to the Debrid's servers. 
        Clicking this link sends a request to your Debrid provider to start downloading that torrent. 
        Clicking it poses no risk to you. I leave this unchecked.
    - `Don't show debrid catalog`: This will show a catalogue showing the videos you have watched before using your Debrid provider. 
                                    I check this box as it is unnecessary clutter.
    - `Show P2P torrent links for uncached` :  If checked, this will show links to stream torrents directly. 
                                                There is almost no point to leaving this checked as it poses a risk to you if not in a country that doesn't care about piracy. 
                                                I have this unchecked.

Now we are done configuring Torrentio. 
The next step is to click `Install`. 
Doing so should automatically open Stremio prompting you to install once again.

<h3>Result Example</h3>

Now, I will explain the results that you see from Torrentio in Stremio.

![Torrentio Result Example](/img/stremio/torrentio_result.png)

<h4>Debrid status</h4>

You will only see this if you have configured a debrid provider.
:::note
I will use RD here, but it can be any debrid provider you have chosen. e.g. DL, PM, etc.
:::

In this example, you can see `[RD+]` in front of the title. This means that the torrent was found on a Real Debrid server and you can stream it without any issues.

If you see `[RD Download]` in front of the title, this means that the torrent was found but not downloaded to the Debrid's servers.
By clicking on this link, you can send a request to your Debrid provider to start downloading that torrent. Once it is downloaded, Torrentio will show `[RD+]` in front of the title.

<h4>Quality Tags</h4>

Underneath the debrid status, you can see the quality of the video. In this case, it is a 4K link with DV (Dolby Vision) and HDR. 
It could also be 1080p, 720p, SCR, CAM, Unknown, etc.

<h4>Torrent Info</h4>

:bust_in_silhouette: - The number of seeders this torrent has. 
If you are using a debrid service, this number is irrelevant to you, unless it is a Debrid Download, in which case, the higher the number, the faster the download.

:floppy_disk: - The size of the video file

:gear: - The indexer that the torrent was found on.

<h4>Language Tags</h4>

Underneath the torrent info, you can see the language tags. In this case, it has a lot. 
It will show the languages that are available in the video.
