If you are using Stremio Web on your android phone, then you can add it to your home screen for easy access. Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Open Stremio Web**: Open your browser and go to [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/).
2. **Add it to your home screen**:
    - The steps for this are different depending on the browser you are using.
    - However, generally, you can do this by tapping the three dots and selecting "Add to Home Screen."
3. **Access the app**: The Stremio icon will appear on your home screen, allowing you to access Stremio Web directly.

We aren't quite done just yet. Stremio Web, on its own, does not support torrent playback or streaming videos in the browser.

To overcome these limitations, you can [setup a streaming server on your android phone or desktop.](#stremio-server)

Another method to use Stremio Web on your android phone is to use an external player. This method, however, has some limitations:

    - Torrent streaming is still not possible. This means **a debrid service is required** to stream torrents.
    - No episode progress tracking.
    - Addon-provided subtitles cannot be used (you can still use the embedded subtitles provided by the video file).

Here are the steps to set up an external player:

1. **Open the Stremio Web App**: Tap the Stremio icon on your home screen to open the app.
2. **Dismiss the Warning**: Ignore the "streaming server not available" banner by tapping `Don't show again`.
3. **Access Settings**:
    - Go to the settings menu by tapping the gear icon.
    - Scroll down to the `Player` section and under `Advanced` select `Play in external player`
4. **Choose an External Player**: Select `VLC`, `MX Player` or `Just Player`. Make sure the chosen player is installed on your device.

You can now open a link and it should open in the external player you selected.
