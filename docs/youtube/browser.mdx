## Intro

If you want these features on your browser, it won't require any fancy setup other than pressing a few buttons. 

However, I highly recommend that you use a browser that is not Chromium. 
Due to Google's Manifest V3, many extensions have been broken or have had to remove features.
As a result, adblock may no longer work reliably. 

Other than these concerns, chromium browsers such as Google Chrome have many other privacy concerns which is why it is not recommended to use them.
This is not a guide on web browsers, so I will not be going into detail on this. 
However, I recommend using LibreWolf or Brave, if you still need chromium. 

I personally use Brave. 

With all that being said, lets get started on the guide.
