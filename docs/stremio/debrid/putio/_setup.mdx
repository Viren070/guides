:::info
Put.io offers two plans for which you can either pay monthly or yearly.
One plan gives you 100GB of storage and the other 1TB. Depending on the amount and size of files you will be streaming, choose the plan that suits you best.

I believe that the storage is not made up of the accumulated size of all the files you have downloaded, but rather the amount of files you have downloaded and stored currently.
You can delete files to make space for new ones.

However, I am unsure of the accuracy of this information. If you are considering put.io, then I would recommend contacting their support or looking at their FAQ.
