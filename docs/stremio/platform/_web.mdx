[Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com) is a web version of Stremio doesn't require any signup or installation.

        On PC, playback in the browser will work most of the time. However, you may encounter audio issues and you won't be able to stream torrents without a streaming server.

        Therefore, you will need to [set up a streaming server](extras/stremio-server).

        If you are using Stremio Web on your android phone, then you can add it to your home screen for easy access. Here are the steps to do this:

        1. **Open Stremio Web**: Open your browser and go to [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/).
        2. **Add it to your home screen**:
            - The steps for this are different depending on the browser you are using.
            - However, generally, you can do this by tapping the three dots and selecting "Add to Home Screen."
        3. **Access the app**: The Stremio icon will appear on your home screen, allowing you to access Stremio Web directly.

        We aren't quite done just yet. Stremio Web, on its own, does not support torrent playback or streaming videos in the browser.

        To overcome these limitations, you can setup the streaming server on your phone. To do this, follow the instructions in the [Stremio Server](extras/stremio-server) section.

        Another method to use Stremio Web on your android phone is to use an external player. This method, however, has some limitations:

            - Torrent streaming is still not possible. This means **a debrid service is required** to stream torrents.
            - No episode progress tracking.
            - Addon-provided subtitles cannot be used (you can still use the embedded subtitles provided by the video file).

        Here are the steps to set up an external player:

        1. **Open the Stremio Web App**: Tap the Stremio icon on your home screen to open the app.
        2. **Dismiss the Warning**: Ignore the "streaming server not available" banner by tapping `Don't show again`.
        3. **Access Settings**:
            - Go to the settings menu by tapping the gear icon.
            - Scroll down to the `Player` section and under `Advanced` select `Play in external player`
        4. **Choose an External Player**: Select `VLC`, `MX Player` or `Just Player`. Make sure the chosen player is installed on your device.

        You can now open a link and it should open in the external player you selected.

        The app available in the App Store is very limited and is pretty useless.

        You can, however, install Stremio Web as an app to your device by following these steps:

        1. **Open Stremio Web on Safari**: Open Safari and go to [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/).
        2. **Add it to your home screen**:
            - Tap the box with an arrow located next to the address bar.
            - Scroll down and tap `Add to Home Screen`
        3. **Access the app**: The Stremio icon will appear on your home screen, allowing you to access Stremio Web directly.

        We aren't quite done just yet. Stremio Web, on its own, does not support torrent playback or streaming videos in the browser.

        To work around this limitation, you could [setup a streaming server on your android phone or desktop](extras/stremio-server).
        However, this may be inconvenient as you may not have an android phone or you may not want to leave your desktop on 24/7.

        For this reason, I will go through how to use an external player with Stremio Web first. It does, however, have some limitations.

            - Torrent streaming is still not possible. This means **a debrid service is required** to stream torrents.
            - No episode progress tracking.
            - Addon-provided subtitles cannot be used (you can still use the embedded subtitles provided by the video file).

        Here are the steps to set up an external player on your iPhone or iPad:

        1. **Open the Stremio Web App**: Tap the Stremio icon on your home screen to open the app.
        2. **Dismiss the Warning**: Ignore the "streaming server not available" banner by tapping `Don't show again`.
        3. **Access Settings**:
            - Go to the settings menu by tapping the gear icon.
            - Scroll down to the `Player` section and under `Advanced` select `Play in external player`
        4. **Choose an External Player**: Select "Outplayer" or "VLC" from the options. Make sure the chosen player is installed on your device.

        You can now open a link and it should open in the external player you selected.

If you are only using the web version and do not have the actual app installed, you will struggle to install addons. 
When you click Install on an addon's configuration page, it will not do anything.
For this reason, I recommend installing the addons on another device that has the app installed. 
However, you may also use the [manual method of adding addons through a link](faq#how-do-i-install-an-addon-manually).
