<h3>Description</h3>

The StremThru Store addon is a part of the suite of addons that StremThru provides. This one in particular is designed to provide
streams and catalogues for content that you have in your debrid account.

It can either show up as streams for other titles, and it also provides its own catalogue which lets you index
the content in your debrid account.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To install the StremThru Store addon, go to the configuration page by clicking the `Configure` button above.

There, you'll be met with the list of addons/tools that StremThru provides. Scroll down to the `StremThru Store` section and click `Configure`.

- `Store Name` - Choose your debrid service.
- `Store Token` - Obtain your API key from your debrid provider and paste it here. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))

Additionally, you can choose to enable or disable the following options:

- `Hide Catalogs`- If you don't want to see the catalogues for your debrid account, check this box to remove it.
- `Hide Streams` - If you don't want to see the streams for your debrid account, check this box to remove it.
- `Enable WebDL` - Enable this option if you want to include hoster download links in StremThru Store. (This includes downloads from services like RapidGator, Uploaded, etc.)

Now, simply click `Install` to open Stremio with a prompt to install the addon. If that doesn't work, you'll see a  
`Manifest URL` field where you'll be able to click the `Copy`, use the copied manifest URL to [install the addon manually](/stremio/faq#how-do-i-install-an-addon-manually).
