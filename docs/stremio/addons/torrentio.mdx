<h3>Description</h3>

[Torrentio](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/torrentio-scraper) is a torrent search addon that scrapes public trackers. (For a in depth explanation of how Torrentio works, see [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/19fmjlp/comment/kjlnwru/))

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To begin, head over to [Torrentio's config page](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) to manage the addon.

Torrentio has a lot of options to customise your experience. I will go through each option explaining what it does and list my preferences and why.

![Torrentio Configuration](/img/stremio/torrentio_setup.png)

- `Providers`: I have them all checked. This is to maximise results. You can uncheck foreign providers to remove potential foreign language results.
- `Sorting`: By quality then size. If you are not using a debrid service, then do By quality then seeders . This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
- `Priority foreign language`: The language you set here will be shown first in the results. You can do this if you prefer a specific language. I leave this as None as I want English audio. 
- `Exclude qualities`: This option allows you to remove certain qualities from the search results. I exclude *Screener* and *CAM* sources. If you have slower internet or your devices aren't capable of playing 4K content, you may want to exclude 4K sources.
- `Max results per quality`: This option will limit the number of results shown for each quality. I leave this blank to obtain all results.
- `Video size limit`: This option will limit the size of the video. If your internet or device is not capable of streaming large files, you may want to set a limit. I leave this blank.
- `Debrid provider`: Choose your Debrid provider if you are using one. If not, skip the rest of the options.
    :::tip
    If you are using more than one debrid provider, you can choose a different provider in the same configuration and when you install the addon, you will get results from each provider you have chosen and given an API key for.

    Torrentio will query the first debrid provider you choose and only if it doesn't find the torrent there will it query the next provider.
    :::
- `API Key`: Click *here*. This link will take you to your debrid provider's website where you can obtain your API key. Copy that and paste it here. (Struggling to find the API key? [click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- `Debrid options`
    - `Don't show download to debrid`: These links will be displayed with a [.. Download] in front of them. 
        These are torrents that were found but not downloaded to the Debrid's servers. 
        Clicking this link sends a request to your Debrid provider to start downloading that torrent. 
        Clicking it poses no risk to you. I leave this unchecked.
    - `Don't show debrid catalog`: This will show catalogue(s) containing files that you have previously downloaded with your Debrid provider.
                                    I check this box as it is unnecessary clutter.

Now we are done configuring Torrentio. 
The next step is to click `Install`. 
Doing so should automatically open Stremio prompting you to install once again.
