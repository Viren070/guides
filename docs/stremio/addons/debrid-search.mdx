<h3>Description</h3>

The Debrid Search addon will search torrents and downloads you have in your debrid account.

It allows you to add torrents to your debrid account beforehand and then stream them in Stremio.

It does not search for links on anywhere but your own account.
You will have to add any torrents/downloads to your debrid account first, before they can be shown in Stremio.

This addon would provide these streams as results in Stremio.
Although there is a catalogue, it requires the `Don't show debrid catalog` to be disabled in the [Torrentio](/stremio/addons/torrentio) addon settings.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To install the Debrid Search addon, go to the configuration page by clicking the `Configure` button above.

Here, you can configure the following settings:

- `Debrid Provider` - Choose your debrid service.
- `Debrid API Key` - Obtain your API key from your debrid provider and paste it here. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))

Now, simply click `Install` to open Stremio with a prompt to install the addon or right click / hold the `Install` button to copy the link to [install the addon manually](/stremio/faq#how-do-i-install-an-addon-manually).
