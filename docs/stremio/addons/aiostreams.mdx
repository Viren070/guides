<h3>Description</h3>

Combine all your streams with all your services into one addon and display them with consistent formatting, sorting, and filtering after removing duplicates.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

I would highly recommend self-hosting this addon.
It is very easy to do, and you can use the guides on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams) to do it. 
I wrote these guides myself, and they should be very simple to follow. 

If you really don't feel like self-hosting, you can continue to use the community ElfHosted instance. This instance does have some relatively light rate-limits.
However, this should be fine for most users. 

:::note
The services section of the addon only applies to officially supported addons. So if you enter your EasyDebrid API key, it will only return EasyDebrid streams from 
MediaFusion. However, you can enter other addons that support EasyDebrid (like Debridio) into the custom addon field using the manifest URL you get after 
configuring at the addon's website.
