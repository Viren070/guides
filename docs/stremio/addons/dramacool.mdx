<h3>Configuration</h3>

**TMDB Catalogs**:
    - Any items from these catalogs will have streams from other addons (not from the dramacool addon). This means it is purely for cataloging purposes.

**DramaCool Catalogs / Kisskh**:
    - Any items from these catalogs will have streams from the dramacool addon and the dramacool addon only. i.e. no other addons will be queried for streams.

**RPDB**:
    - If you would like to see ratings on the poster, you can enter your RPDB API key here. ([How do I get a RPDB API Key?](/stremio/faq#how-do-i-obtain-a-rpdb-api-key))

**Real Debrid**:
    - If you have a Real Debrid account, you can enter your API key here. ([How do I get a Real Debrid API Key?](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
      :::note
      You will only get real debrid streams if there is a cached stream available. Otherwise, you will get the normal http streams.
