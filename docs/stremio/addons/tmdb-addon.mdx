<h3>Description</h3>

The TMDB addon that will fetch data from The Movie Database to display Popular and New Movies and Series.

You should use this addon instead of Cinemeta as in some cases, it may have more up-to-date metadata, resulting in more links.
TMDB also supports catalogues in several languages, whereas Cinemeta only supports English.

The TMDB addon also provides several more integrations such as:

- **Streaming Catalogs**: Allows you to see catalogues of movies and series from various streaming services.
- **Gemini AI Search**: Allows you to search for movies and series using Gemini AI. This lets you search things like "Movies about space" and it would return relevant results.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

1. Head to the TMDB Addon Configuration page using the `Configure` button above.
2. You'll be presented with an option to choose your language. Choose your preferred language from the dropdown menu.
3. To proceed with the configuration/installation, you need to access the sidebar. This may not show up on mobile devices, in which case you'll need to set this up on a desktop.

   - `Ratings on Posters`: This will show the ratings on the posters of the movies and series. ([How do I obtain a RPDB API Key?](/stremio/faq#how-do-i-obtain-a-rpdb-api-key))
