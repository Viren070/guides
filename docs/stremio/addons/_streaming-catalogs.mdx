This addon is very similar to CyberFlix. It only provides 2 catalogues for each streaming service instead of 4. 

1. Head over to the [Streaming Catalogs Configuration page](https://7a82163c306e-stremio-netflix-catalog-addon.baby-beamup.club/)
2. Click on the filter providers by country and select Any. 
3. Select the streaming services that you want to see in your home page for Stremio.
4. Optionally provide your [RPDB API key](faq#how-do-i-obtain-a-rpdb-api-key) to show ratings on the posters.
5. Click Install addon and then when the Stremio app opens with a prompt asking to install, click Install again.
