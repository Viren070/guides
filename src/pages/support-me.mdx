# Support Me

## Why do I need support?

Although I have previously said that I wouldn't accept money, I realised that I would need to continue paying for the domain (viren070.me).

I had initially got the domain for free and thought about what to do with it. 
I had already written a guide on Stremio and decided to host it on the domain without much thought.
Now that the domain has been linked to in many places, I can't let the domain expire as it would cause issues. 

I would greatly appreciate any help in keeping the domain up. 
I will remove this page once the domain has been paid for the year. 

## Other ways to support me

If you can't / don't want to, that's fine too. I appreciate you reading this page and using the guides I have written.
You can instead leave a star on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Viren070/guides).
