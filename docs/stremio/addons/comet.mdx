<h3>Description</h3>

[Comet](https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet) is a self hostable torrent/debrid search addon. 

One of its distinguishing features is that it supports using Proxy Debrid streams. 
This allows the use of Debrid streams on multiple IPs at the same time on the same account.

However, you will have to use comet exclusively, no other addon that uses the same debrid should be being used at the same time as it will have a different IP address to the proxy. 

You can read more about its features on the [Comet GitHub page](https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet?tab=readme-ov-file#features)

:::note
The proxy feature is not available on the public ElfHosted instance. You can use the public version with other addons just fine.
It is only if you enable the proxy feature when self hosting (or using a custom ElfHosted instance) that you will have to use Comet exclusively.
:::

Comet can be [selfhosted](https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet?tab=readme-ov-file#self-hosted) or [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/comet/).

For this guide, I will go through the setup using the free, public ElfHosted instance. If you don't want to selfhost but want more customisation, you can pay for your own instance on ElfHosted.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://comet.elfhosted.com/configure)

- `Indexers` - Choose which indexers you want to use. I leave all of them checked to obtain the most results
- `Language` - Choose which language you want your results to have. I leave the following selected: Multi and English. You can select more if you are going to watch content in other languages (e.g. japanese for anime)
- `Resolutions` - Choose which resolutions you want your results to have. I leave all of them selected to obtain the most results.
- `Max Results` - The maximum number of results to display. I set this to 20 so I don't have as many results to scroll through. You can leave it at 0 to display all results.- `Debrid Service` - Choose your debrid service.
- `Max Size` - The maximum size of the torrent to display. I leave this at 0. If your internet is slow or your device is incapable of streaming large files, you can set a lower maximum size here.
- `Debrid API Key` - Obtain your API key from your debrid provider and paste it here. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- **Advanced Settings**:
    - `Remove Trash` - This removes all the CAM and Screener sources from the results. It also attempts to remove adult content. I leave this checked.
    - `Reverse Result Order` - Comet normally sorts torrents based on a [smart torrent ranking](https://github.com/dreulavelle/rank-torrent-name). This will reverse the order of the results to show the 'worst' torrents firs. 
                               I leave this unchecked. However, this could be useful for anyone who has slow internet speeds, bandwidth caps, or devices that can't handle high-quality streams.
    - `Result Format` - Choose the information you want to see in the results. I leave all of them selected.

Then either click `Install` to open Stremio with a prompt to install the addon or click `Copy Link` to copy the addon URL to paste into Stremio manually.

<h3>Result Example</h3>

Now, I will explain the results that you see from Comet in Stremio.

![Comet Result Example](/img/stremio/comet_result.png)

<h4>Debrid status</h4>

You will only see this if you have configured a debrid provider.

:::note
I will use RD here, but it can be any debrid provider you have chosen. e.g. DL, PM, etc.
:::

Comet only returns cached results by default. All links are safe to play as you would be streaming from your debrid provider's servers.
Sometimes, this information may be innacurate. However, it will simply play a video saying the link is not cached. You will not be torrenting. 

<h4>Resolution Tags</h4>

Underneath the debrid status, you will see the resolution of the video. 
In the example, it is 2160p (4K).

<h4>Quality Tags</h4>

Underneath the filename, you will see the quality tags of the video next to this:

ðŸ’¿ - It will tell you if the file is a BluRay REMUX, DV, HDR etc.

:floppy_disk: - The size of the video file

ðŸ”Ž - Shows the indexer the torrent was found through
