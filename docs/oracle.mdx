# Free Oracle VPS

## Introduction

Oracle Cloud offers a Compute Instance with 4 OCPUs, 24GB RAM, and 200GB storage within their "Always Free" resources.
This guide will show you how to set that up.

A VPS can be used for a variety of purposes, such as hosting a website, running a game server, or even as a remote desktop.
You can even use it to host all your [Stremio](/stremio/) addons and a debrid media server.

:::info
To use the Oracle Cloud Free Tier, you need a valid credit/debit card. Virtual/Prepaid cards are not accepted.
:::

## Setup

### Setting up our VM instance

1. Sign up for an Oracle Cloud account.

   1. Go to the [Oracle Cloud website](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) and click on "Start for free".
   2. Sign up for an account by filling in your details.

      :::tip
      Many people tend to have issues with the verification process when
      signing up for Oracle Cloud. If you face any issues, try one of the
      following:

      - Ensure your billing address matches the address **exactly** as it appears on your bank statement or banking app.
      - Use an inPrivate window on [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
      - Use a different email address.
      - Use a different card.
      - Disable any adblockers/VPNs.
        <br />
        If you still face issues, you can try using a contacting Oracle support
        through the live chat widget in the bottom right corner of the Oracle
        Cloud website.

      :::

2. Once you have signed up, you will be taken to the Oracle Cloud dashboard. Click on `Create a VM instance` under the `Build` section.

   ![Oracle Cloud Dashboard](/img/oracle/dashboard.png)

3. Give your instance a name.

4. Configure the image and shape

   1. Scroll down to `Image and shape`, and click on `Change Image`. Select the 'Ubuntu' image and 'Canonical Ubuntu 24.04' image name.

      ![Change Image](/img/oracle/select_image.png)

   2. Just below the image, you will see the `Shape` section. Click on `Change Shape` and select the `Ampere` series `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` shape. Set the OCPUs to 4, and the memory to 24GB.
      ![Change Shape](/img/oracle/select_shape.png)

5. Generate an SSH key pair. If you already have an SSH key pair, you can skip this step.

   1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
   2. Run the following command to generate an SSH key pair, replacing `your_email@example.com` with your email address.

      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
      ```

      - When prompted for which file to save the key in, press `Enter` to save it in the default location. If you already have an SSH key pair, you can save it in a different location. But make sure to remember where you saved it.
      - When prompted to enter a passphrase, you **should** enter one. You can generate a passphrase using a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass).

      <br/ >
      :::info
      On older systems, where the ed25519 algorithm is not supported, you can use the rsa algorithm:

      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
      ```

      :::

   3. We will now need to add our SSH key to our SSH agent. Before we do that, we need to start the SSH agent. Open a new **Administrator** PowerShell window and run the following commands:
      ```
      Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
      Start-Service ssh-agent
      ```
   4. Run the following command in your **non-administrator** terminal to add your SSH key to the SSH agent:

      ```bash
      ssh-add C:/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_ed25519
      ```

      - If you saved your SSH key in a different location, replace `C:/Users/your_username/.ssh/id_ed25519` with the path to your SSH key.

   5. You will now have two files in your `~/.ssh` directory: `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`. The `.pub` file is your public key, which you will need for the next step.

6. In the `Add SSH keys` section, click the `Upload public key files (.pub)` button and upload the `.pub` file you generated in the previous step.

7. Configure our boot volume.

   1. Scroll down to `Boot volume` and check the `Specify a custom boot volume size` box.
   2. Set the boot volume size to 200.
   3. Set the `Boot volume performance to `120`.

8. Finally, click on `Create` to create your VM instance.

:::tip
You may encounter an `Out of capacity` error when creating your VM instance. This is because the free tier has a limited number of instances available:
![Out of capacity error](/img/oracle/availability_error.png)

You can try again later, or you can try creating the instance in a different `Availability Domain` by scrolling back up to the top to the `Placement` section.

You can also switch to a PAYG account, which will allow you to create instances without any restrictions. As long as you stay within the free tier limits, you won't be charged.
You can also set up a $1 budget alert to ensure you don't go over the free tier limits.

4. Click on `Upgrade to Pay-As-You-Go` and follow the instructions.

It can take up to 24 hours for the upgrade to take effect. You will receive an email once the upgrade is complete.

      6. Click on `Apply`.
      7. You will now see a forecast of your usage. There will be a graph showing your usage over time, and a table showing your usage by service.
      8. Ensure it is all 0.
    </div>

9. Your instance will now begin provisioning. This can take a few minutes. Once it is done, make your way to the dashboard of your instance. You should
   already be on the dashboard, but if you aren't, you can find it by clicking on the hamburger menu in the top left corner and scrolling down to `Compute` and then `Instances`.

### Connecting to our VM instance

10. Copy the public IP address of your instance.

    ![Instance Dashboard](/img/oracle/instance_dashboard.png)

11. Open a terminal on your local machine and run the following command, replacing `your_ip` with the public IP address of your instance.

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@your_ip
    ```

    - If you are prompted to add the host to your list of known hosts, type `yes` and press `Enter`.
    - If you set a passphrase for your SSH key, you will be prompted to enter it. (You will not see any characters as you type, but it is being entered.)
      :::tip
      To avoid having to type the IP address every time you want to connect to your instance, you can create a Windows Terminal Profile.

      To do this:

      1.  Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow next to the tabs. Then, while holding down the `Shift` key, click on `Settings`.
      2.  This will open the `settings.json` file in your default text editor. It will look something like this:

          ```json
          {
            "$help": ...,
            "$schema":  ...,
            "actions": ...,
            ...
            "profiles": {
              "defaults": {},
              "list": [
                ...
              ]
            }
          }
          ```

      3.  Add the following profile to the `profiles` list, replacing `your_ip` with the public IP address of your instance:

                ```json
                {
                  "closeOnExit": "never",
                  "name": "Oracle VPS",
                  "commandline": "ssh ubuntu@your_ip",
                },
                ```

          :::

12. You are now connected to your VM instance. You can now install any software you need, set up a web server, or do anything
    else you need to do.

## Extra guides

### Hosting Stremio addons

If you are interesting in self hosting Stremio addons, you can use my [template compose.yaml](https://github.com/Viren070/stremio-addons-docker-compose-template).
The template contains more than just Stremio addons, so ensure you modify it to your needs.

### Opening ports

By default, all ports are closed on your Oracle VPS. You will need to open the ports you want to use.

1. Go to the dashboard of your instance.
2. Under `Primary VNIC`, click on the link next to `Subnet:`.
3. Under `Security Lists`, click on the `Default Security List for vcn-...`.
4. Click on `Add Ingress Rules`.
5. Add the following rules:
   - `Source Type`: `CIDR`
   - `Source CIDR`: `0.0.0.0/0`
   - `IP Protocol`: `TCP`
   - `Source Port Range`: `All`
   - `Destination Port Range`: The port you want to open, such as `443` for HTTPS.
   - `Description`: A description of the rule, such as `Allow HTTPS traffic`.
6. Click on `Add Ingress Rules`, or `Another Ingress Rule` if you want to add more rules.
