# Guide
I will now begin the guide to setting up Stremio and its addons. I recommend that the **initial setup is completed on your laptop or desktop**. Once it has been setup, you can log in to Stremio with the same account on any device and your configuration will be synced to the device so there is no need to set it up again.

## Creating a Stremio Account

First, we need to create a Stremio account. This allows you to keep your progress on different content synced across devices and also allows you to sync your configuration so that it does not need to be repeated.

Head over to [Stremio](https://stremio.com/) and either [sign up for an account](https://www.stremio.com/register) with an email or [login](https://stremio.com/login) through Facebook.

## Downloading Stremio
Head to the [downloads page](https://stremio.com/downloads) and download the required package.

If you can't find the download link for your device, I will go through the instructions for each device here.

:::warning
iOS users, I recommend that you follow the instructions in the iOS tab as the Stremio app available in the App Store is very limited and will not provide the full experience.
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="pc" label="PC" default>

    For windows, download the following: 

    ![Windows Download](./img/stremio_win_download.png)


    For Mac OS, download one of the following depending on your version of Mac OS:

    ![Mac Download](./img/stremio_mac_download.png)

    For Linux, download one of the following:
    
    ![Linux Download](./img/stremio_linux_download.png)

    There are packages available for popular distributions of Linux such as Debian and Arch Linux. However, there is also a flatpak link as well as a link to the source code. 

    The flatpak can be used to install Stremio on the Steam Deck too. 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android" label="Android">
    
    Stremio can be installed from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stremio.one).

    However, you can also download one of the following:

    ![Android Download](./img/stremio_android_download.png)

    You will most likely need to download the ARM64 APK.

    - ARM (armeabi-v7a) - 32 bit 
    - ARM64 (arm64-v8a) - 64 bit 
    - x86 - 32 bit Intel 
    - x86_64 - 64 bit Intel


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">


    As the app in the App Store is a limited version, you can follow this [blog post](https://blog.stremio.com/using-stremio-web-on-iphone-ipad/) to set up a PWA (Progressive Web App). 
    This will give you access to most of Stremio's features. 

    Although following the blog post will give you access to most of Stremio's features, it will not allow you to stream torrents. 
    This means you can only use HTTP addons which are mostly unreliable. However, there are two ways to gain access to the massive library of torrents through Stremio. 

    The first way is to pay for a debrid service. This will allow you to stream torrents through HTTP. This is the easiest and most recommended way to use Stremio on iOS.
    To use this method, simply follow the guide as normal but you must also set up a debrid service.

    The second way is to have another device running the [Stremio service](https://www.stremio.com/download-service). You then connect to the Stremio service on your iOS device. This way will allow you to stream torrents directly on Stremio.
    Follow this [blog post](https://blog.stremio.com/using-stremio-service/) to set up the Stremio service.

## Debrid Service (Optional)

As explained before, a debrid service is not required. However, it removes the need for a VPN and removes the reliance on seeders for torrents by streaming from their servers at unrestricted speeds through HTTP which makes playing 4K content easy. For more details, please see [Debrid Services](technical-details#debrid-services) and the [FAQ](faq). 

Furthermore, a debrid service can be used to generate direct download links for any torrents such as games, software, music etc. without the need for a VPN as the torrenting is done by the debrid service.

### Which debrid service do I use?

There are many debrid services available to use. I will provide a tutorial for setting up Real Debrid and AllDebrid below but the setup for others will be very similar.

Here is a list of some other debrid services:
- [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/)
- [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.com/)
- [Offcloud](https://offcloud.com/)
- [Put.io](https://put.io/)

The main factors to consider are cost and optimality. The two options that provide the greatest cost-value benefit are Real Debrid and AllDebrid. They are priced at the same point and the larger userbase ensures more torrents are regularly cached.
The average monthly cost for Real Debrid and AllDebrid comes down to around £2.30 if you get the 6-month subscription.

What I mean by optimality is how close you are to the servers of the Debrid service. The closer you are, the higher download speeds you will get from a Debrid Service. 

You can use these speed tests to test the speed (You may need to create an account before being able to test your speeds):
- [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/speedtest)
- [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/speedtest)
- [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/speedtest)

One other factor to consider is whether streaming from multiple IP addresses is important to you. 
Most of these Debrid services will only allow you to use their service from one IP address at a time. 
This means you can use it from an unlimited number of devices from any one IP address at a given time. 
You cannot, for example, use it on your mobile data while another device in your home uses your home network to use the debrid service. 

**If you do use 2 IP addresses at a given time, you risk having your account banned.**

If streaming from multiple IP addresses is important to you, then consider getting Premiumize as it allows multiple IP addresses. It does, however, set a limit on the storage of files you can have in your cloud storage.

:::info
All-Debrid does provide a free 7 day trial. If you are not sure that this is the right choice for you, I suggest that you use this 7 day trial to test it out. You can also buy the service for 15 days which will cost a small amount but can be used to test it out.
:::

I will now cover the instructions of setting up a Debrid Service. I will only cover setting up Real Debrid and AllDebrid.

## Setting up Addons

As I mentioned before, the intial setup should be done on a laptop/desktop or an android device. Once you have set up the addons, you can log in to Stremio on any device and your configuration will be synced to that device.

Before we install the addons, we need to go through some of the pre-installed addons.

### Removing pre-installed addons

![Default Addon Catalogues](./img/watchhub_movie_details.png)

![Default Addons](./img/default_addon_catalogues.png)

The first picture above shows that when you click on a movie, Stremio will display links to third party streaming services that provide the selected content. The addon that does this is called WatchHub. 

The second picture shows catalogues from two different addons - YouTube and Public Domain Movies. The YouTube addon will show popular YouTube channels and allow you to view their latest videos. The Public Domain Movies addon will show movies that are now in the [Public Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain). Most of these movies are quite old and released in the 1900s. 

These addons are not required so it is recommended that they be removed. If, however, you prefer to keep them, then you may do so.

To remove these addons, go to the addons page (the puzzle icon on the navigation menu on the left of the screen) and click Uninstall on the following addons.

![Addon menu with default addons](./img/default_addons_page.png)

### Stream Provider Addons
:::info
You will encounter issues if you attempt to set up addons on iOS. If, for whatever reason, you **need** to set up addons on iOS, then do the following to avoid issues:

Once an addon has been configured, attempt to find the URL. 
This may be given already or you might need to copy the link from the `Install` button. 
Some addons copy the link to your clipboard when you click install.

Now that you have the link, open Stremio, go to the addons page and paste the link into the search bar. 

If this still doesn't work, you should complete the initial setup on another device. You can borrow an android phone / laptop or go to the library. 
:::
These addons are the backbone to our on-demand streaming experience. They provide the video content that allows us to watch anything we want.

Torrentio is the most popular addon and should be all that you need for all your content. However, it is not harmful to have backups installed.

Many of the alternative addons will be hosted on [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/). Although you have to pay for private instances of the addon, they provide free instances with a reasonable rate limit. Through casual viewing, these rate limits are unlikely to be hit and they are only in place to protect ElfHosted from people using automation.

I will only provide detailed instructions for Torrentio and KnightCrawler. Other addons will follow a similar structure to setting up. Ensure that any option relating to direct torrenting is disabled if you do not want to torrent and customise the addon as you wish.
<details>
    <summary>Torrentio</summary>
    <div>
    To begin, head over to [Torrentio's config page](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) to manage the addon.
    
    Torrentio has a lot of options and it can be overwhelming at first. Below I've listed my recommendations and my personal configuration:
    
    ![Torrentio Configuration](./img/torrentio_setup.png)
    
    - `Providers`: I have them all checked excluding foreign languages.
    - `Sorting`: By quality then size. If you are not using a debrid service, then do By quality then seeders . This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
    - `Priority foreign language`: Torrentio defaults to pulling English audio content regardless of origin source, so only change this if you prefer another language to display first.
    - `Exclude qualities`: If checked, the quality types selected will be excluded and suppressed from your search results. I only exclude *screener, CAM* and *Unknown* sources, therefore the only boxes I have checked are *screener, CAM* and *Unknown*. If you have slower internet or your devices aren’t capable of playing 4k content, you may want to exclude 4K sources.
    - `Max results per quality`: I leave this blank to obtain all results.
    - `Debrid provider`: Choose your Debrid provider if you are using one. If not, skip the rest of the options.
    - `API Key`: Click *here*. This link will take you to your debrid provider's website where you can obtain your API key. Copy that and paste it here.
    - `Debrid options`
        - `Don't show download to debrid`: These links will be displayed with a Debrid Download] in front of them. These are torrents that were found but not downloaded to the Debrid’s servers. Clicking this link sends a request to your Debrid provider to start downloading that torrent. Clicking it poses no risk to you. I leave this unchecked.
        - `Don't show debrid catalog`: This will show a catalogue showing the videos you have watched before using your Debrid provider. I check this box as it is unnecessary clutter.
        - `Show P2P torrent links for uncached` :  If checked, this will show links to stream torrents directly. There is almost no point to leaving this checked as it poses a risk to you if not in a third world country that doesn’t care about piracy. I have this unchecked.
    
    Now we are done configuring Torrentio. The next step is to click `Install`. Doing so should automatically open Stremio prompting you to install once again.
    (For a in depth explanation of how Torrentio works, see [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/19fmjlp/comment/kjlnwru/).)
    </div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary> KnightCrawler (ElfHosted)</summary>
    <div>
    KnightCrawler is a fork of Torrentio and the setup for it is almost the same.
    
    To begin, head over to [KnightCrawler’s config page](https://knightcrawler.elfhosted.com/configure)
    
    ![KnightCrawler Configuration](./img/knightcrawler_setup.png)
    
    - `Sorting`: By quality then size. If you are not using a debrid service, then do By quality then seeders . This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
    - `Priority foreign language`: Torrentio defaults to pulling English audio content regardless of origin source, so only change this if you prefer another language to display first.
    - `Exclude qualities`: If checked, the quality types selected will be excluded and suppressed from your search results. I only exclude *screener, CAM* and *Unknown* sources, therefore the only boxes I have checked are *screener, CAM* and *Unknown*. If you have slower internet or your devices aren’t capable of playing 4k content, you may want to exclude 4K sources.
    - `Max results per quality`: I leave this blank to obtain all results.
    - `Debrid provider`: Choose your Debrid provider if you are using one. If not, skip the rest of the options
    - `API Key`: Click *here*. This link will take you to your debrid provider where you can obtain your API key. Copy that and paste it here.
    - `Debrid options`
        - `Don't show download to debrid`: These links will be displayed with a [Debrid Download] in front of them. These are torrents that were found but not downloaded to the Debrid's servers. Clicking this link sends a request to your Debrid provider to start downloading that torrent. Clicking it poses no risk to you. I leave this unchecked.
        - `Don't show debrid catalog`: This will show a catalogue showing the videos you have watched before using your Debrid provider. I check this box as it is unnecessary clutter.
        - `Show P2P torrent links for uncached` :  If checked, this will show links to stream torrents directly. There is almost no point to leaving this checked as it poses a risk to you if not in a third world country that doesn’t care about piracy. I have this unchecked.
    
    Now we are done configuring KnightCrawler. The next step is to click `INSTALL`. Doing so should automatically open Stremio prompting you to install once again. Click Install again and the addon should be installed.
    </div>
</details>
Here is a list of other addons that use torrent streams with debrid support. These may also have additional features and provide more content in some scenarios.:

- [Stremio-Jackett](https://stremio-jackett.elfhosted.com/configure)
- [Jackettio](https://jackettio.elfhosted.com/configure)
- [MediaFusion](https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com/configure) (provides sports/live TV)
- [Annatar](https://annatar.elfhosted.com/configure) 
- [Orion](https://orionoid.com/) 

If you do not want to use a debrid service or a torrent addon, you can use HTTP addons. These addons will provide links to stream content from third party sources. The speeds will be slower than torrents and you may encounter buffering.
Here is a list of some HTTP addons:
- [JaMovies](https://eja-addon.vercel.app/) (Only 1 stream but provides 1080p links from VidSrc)
- [Shluflix](https://shluflix.elfhosted.com/configure)
- [Stremify](https://stremify.elfhosted.com/configure)

:::warning
As addons are community provided, the addons provided here may become outdated or superseded by new ones. 
Use this [community hosted addon list](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/) to view all the available addons. 
This list will have more addons listed than the ones shown in the Stremio app.
:::

The basic setup for Stremio has now been completed. You can now search for a movie and you will be provided with high quality links to stream from.

However, your home page will be quite empty. The next section will go through how to populate your home page with popular movies and shows. 
You will also not have any subtitles, so I highly recommend that you continue to read this guide to the end to get the full experience.

It is also possible to populate your homepage with customised lists such as recommendations or a list that dynamically updates according to strict filters that you can customise. 
I will go through this in the [Using Trakt](using-trakt) section of this guide. I highly recommend that you read this section as it will provide you with a more personalised experience.

### Catalogue Addons

These are the addons that provide the different catalogues (the rows of movies/shows) on your Stremio homepage. 
They can provide catalogues that pull content from popular streaming services (e.g. Netflix Movies - Popular) or from databases like The Movie Database (TMDB) or IMDB (e.g. Movies - Trending)

There is one built-in addon called Cinemata which provides Popular and Featured Movies and Series. 
However, there may be some shows that provide more results with the TMDB addon, so I highly recommend that you install the TMDB addon.

I will go through the most popular addons that are used currently. 

:::note
CyberFlix and Streaming Catalogs are very similar and will show very similar content. I recommend that you only install one of them
:::

<details>
<summary>TMDB Addon</summary>
    <div>
    
    The TMDB addon that will fetch data from The Movie Database to display Popular and New Movies and Series. 
    
    ![TMDB Configuration](./img/tmdb_setup_1.png)
    
    1. Head to the [TMDB Addon Configuration page](https://94c8cb9f702d-tmdb-addon.baby-beamup.club/configure)
    2. Configure the catalogue settings to your liking. (The ratings on poster is not required)
    3. Select your language.
    4. Click Install. 
    5. Stremio should now open and a prompt asking you to install should appear, click Install again.
    
    ![TMDB Installation](./img/tmdb_setup_2.png)
    
    The addon should now be installed.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>IMDB Catalogs</summary>
    <div>
    This addon will add a catalogue that fetches movies and shows from IMDB. This addon requires no configuration, so it can be installed from directly within the Stremio app. 
    
    1. Head to the addons page on the Stremio app
    2. Click on the Community Addons tab
    3. Search for `IMDB Catalog` and it should be the first result. 
    4. Click Install.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>CyberFlix</summary>
    <div>
    
    This Addon will fetch a list of movies from a range of different 3rd party streaming services as well as different catalogs for Kids, Anime, and Indian Movies. (It is recommended that you use the Kitsu Addon for Anime instead)
    
    To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://cyberflix.elfhosted.com/)
    
    ![CyberFlix Setup](./img/cyberflix_setup.png)
    
    1. Click Setup
    2. Select up to 60 different catalogues to display on your homepage. Click the arrows to select/deselect specific types of catalogues for a streaming service.
    3. Click Next
    4. Rearrange the order of the catalogues to your liking and click Next again
    5. Then click Install on Stremio and a prompt should open in the Stremio app. Click Install on that prompt too.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Streaming Catalogs</summary>
    <div>
    
    This addon is very similar to CyberFlix. It only provides 2 catalogues for each streaming service instead of 4.
    
    1. Head over to the [Streaming Catalogs Configuration page](https://7a82163c306e-stremio-netflix-catalog-addon.baby-beamup.club/)
    2. Click on the filter providers by country and select Any.
    3. Select the streaming services that you want to see in your home page for Stremio.
    4. Click Install addon and then when the Stremio app opens with a prompt asking to install, click Install again.
    </div>
</details>

#### Anime Addons 

I will now go through some Anime catalogue addons. A reminder that these addons are only catalogue addons and do not provide any links themselves. 
However, Torrentio with the NyaaSi and AniDex providers enabled should provide you the necessary links. 

The Stremify addon also provides streams from Gogoanime if you are looking for http streams. 

Scroll up to the [Stream Provider Addons section](#stream-provider-addons) to see how to configure Torrentio and Stremify.

:::note
If you are planning to only watch on an android device, you may want to look into [Aniyomi](https://aniyomi.org) instead. 
It also has a torrentio extension that supports watching normal movies/show.
:::
<details>
<summary>Kitsu</summary>
    <div>
    
    This addon is focused on providing catalogues for Anime. It provides Top Airing, Trending, Most Popular, Highest Rated, and Newest. It is recommended to use this addon for anime as you are more likely to get stream results with the metadata from the Kitsu addon.
    
    Similar to the IMDB Catalogs addon, this addon cannot be configured. I could not find the addon through the built in community addon search so I will go through the steps for installing an addon through the search bar.
    
    1. Copy this URL: [https://anime-kitsu.strem.fun/manifest.json](https://anime-kitsu.strem.fun/manifest.json)
    2. In the stremio application, paste the URL into any search bar. (main one or addon search bar). 
    3. A prompt should show giving you the option to install this addon. 
    
    You may also configure the [Anime Catalogs addon](https://1fe84bc728af-stremio-anime-catalogs.baby-beamup.club/configure) too.
    </div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Anime Catalogs</summary>
    <div>
    
    This addon is similar to the Kitsu addon but provides a lot more catalogues from different sources (AniList, Kitsu, MyAnimeList, AniDB)
    
    1. Head over to the [Anime Catalogs Configuration page](https://1fe84bc728af-stremio-anime-catalogs.baby-beamup.club/configure)
    2. Select the catalogues that you want to see on your homepage.
    3. Click Install addon and then when the Stremio app opens with a prompt asking to install, click Install again.
    </div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>animeo</summary>
<div>
This is an addon that uses the AniList API to track your anime progress. 
You can look at the [GitHub page for animeo](https://github.com/Jenrykster/animeo) that explains how to set it up and how it works. 

1. Head over to the [animeo Configuration page](https://7a625ac658ec-animeo.baby-beamup.club/configure)
2. Click `ANILIST LOGIN` at the top of the page and login with your AniList account. You will then be returned to the configration page
3. There are two options to configure, I will go through them now: 
    - `Kitsu entries only`: I recommend keeping this option checked. You will need the kitsu addon installed for this to work. 
                          This means that only when you are watching a title from the Kitsu addon will it be tracked. 
                          This is useful because it reduces the likelihood of incorrect titles being tracked. 
    - `Only update anime already on my list` - This option makes it so that only anime that you are already tracking on AniList will be updated. 
                                               I leave this unchecked as otherwise, new anime that I watch will not be tracked unless I manually add them on AniList.
3. Click Install. (If this doesn't work, follow the instructions underneath the install button that says to copy the link and paste it into the stremio search bars)

## End of guide
Done! 
You have now setup Stremio and have one of the best on demand streaming experiences available. 

I highly recommend that you look at the next page ([Using Trakt](using-trakt)) to have a more personalised experience with recommendations, watchlists, customised catalogues and more. 

I would also recommend that you look at the [Extras](extras) page to see how you can customise or enhance your Stremio experience.
