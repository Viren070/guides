Stremio-gdrive is a self-hosted Stremio addon that allows you to view files from Google Drive. 

For it to work, you will need to join some team drives. You can find some [here](https://t.me/s/teamdrives).

<h3>Configuration</h3>

As mentioned earlier, this addon needs to be self-hosted.

You can use [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShuvamJaswal/Gdrive-Stremio-Update) to set it up.
