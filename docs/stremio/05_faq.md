# FAQ

This FAQ will mostly repeat what has already been said but provide the answers in a more accessible form 

## Is a Debrid Service required?

No. Depending on your circumstances, Stremio and Torrentio without a Debrid service may work fine and 4K content may still stream without buffering. However, torrenting carries a legal risk and if this is an issue for you, a debrid service is recommended. Furthermore, torrenting relies on seeders being available constantly and you are limited by the upload seed of the seeders. With a Debrid Service, this issue is solved as the torrent is downloaded to the Debrid services’ high speed servers. You can then stream content from their servers at high speeds. (The speed is still limited by your own internet connection)

## Do I need a VPN?

If you are using a debrid service, a VPN is NOT required. 

If you are not, it depends on the country you are living in. If your country is strict on piracy, then a VPN is recommended as you may get notices from your ISP otherwise.

If your country is strict on piracy, it is recommended that you pay for a debrid service, as it is often cheaper than a VPN, and the experience on Stremio with a debrid service is much better than a VPN.

## Will I have to repeat the setup process on all of my devices?

No. Your account and its addons are stored on Stremio’s servers. Meaning that it is all in the cloud. As long as you sign in to the same account on a different device, it will sync the addons that are linked with your account and you do not need to repeat the setup process.

## My device was not listed in the supported devices list. Can I still use it?

Yes. Through [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com), any device can use Stremio as long as you log in your account.

## Can I use Stremio to watch Live TV?

Stremio was not designed with Live TV in mind, so its interface for such things is less than ideal. However, MediaFusion does provide live streams. The [xtremio addon](https://xtremio.elfhosted.com/configure) can be used to stream content from your paid IPTV subscription. However, as mentioned before, the interface is not designed for this. I suggest that you try it out and if its not for you, then stick to an app designed for IPTV content or other apps that provide Live TV.

## Where can I find more addons?

Through the Community addons tab in the Addons menu of the Stremio app or the [community hosted addon list](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/)
