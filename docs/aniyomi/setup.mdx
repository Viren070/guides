# Setup


## Downloading Aniyomi

Aniyomi is not available on the Google Play Store, so you'll need to download it from the [official website](https://aniyomi.org/).

:::note 
Before you download Aniyomi, you may want to take a look at the [forks of Aniyomi](/aniyomi/forks) to see if there is a fork that better suits your needs.

The same instructions below can still be followed to download and install a fork of Aniyomi, just use the APK of the fork you want to install.  
:::

1. Go to the [downloads page](https://aniyomi.org/download) on the Aniyomi website.

    ![Aniyomi Downloads Page](/img/aniyomi/downloads.jpg)

2. Click either `Stable` or `Preview` to download the APK file for Aniyomi.
    :::note
    The `Stable` version is the most stable version of Aniyomi, while the `Preview` version is the latest version with new features.
    
    Unless you are willing to encounter bugs, I recommend downloading the `Stable` version.
    :::
3. The file will now begin downloading. You can check your notifications or the downloads section of your browser to see the progress of the download.

    ![Aniyomi Downloading](/img/aniyomi/downloading.jpg)
4. Once the download is complete, you should see a notification in your notification bar. Click on the notification to open the file.

    ![Aniyomi Download Complete](/img/aniyomi/downloaded.jpg)
5. If this is your first time installing an APK file, you may get a warning like this:
    
    ![Aniyomi Install Warning](/img/aniyomi/unknown_apps_1.jpg)

    Click `Settings` to allow the installation of APK files from this source. 

6. You will now be taken to the `Install unknown apps` page. 

    ![Aniyomi Install Unknown Apps](/img/aniyomi/unknown_apps_2.jpg)
    
    Click the `Allow Permisson` toggle next to your browser to allow it to install APK files.

7. You will now be shown the installation prompt. Click `Install` to install Aniyomi. 
    :::note
    If the prompt doesn't show automatically, you can go back to the downloads page in your browser and click on the downloaded file to open the installation prompt.
    or you can go to your file manager and click on the downloaded file to open the installation prompt.
    :::

    ![Aniyomi Install Prompt](/img/aniyomi/install.jpg)

8. Once the installation is complete, you will see a prompt like this:
    
        ![Aniyomi Install Complete](/img/aniyomi/installed.jpg)
    
        Click `Open` to open Aniyomi.

9. You have now successfully installed Aniyomi on your device.


## Setting up Aniyomi


### Onboarding

1. When you first open Aniyomi, you will be greeted with the Welcome screen.

    ![Aniyomi Welcome Screen](/img/aniyomi/onboarding_1.jpg)

    You can choose from a variety of themes. Once you have chosen your theme, click `Next`.

2. You will now be asked to select a storage folder. This is where Aniyomi will store downloads, backups and more. 

    ![Aniyomi Storage Folder](/img/aniyomi/onboarding_2.jpg)

    Click `Select Folder` to choose a folder. I recommend creating a new folder called `Aniyomi` in your internal storage or SD card.
    So it should say `/storage/emulated/0/Aniyomi`

3. Once you select a folder, android will ask you to allow Aniyomi to access your storage. Click `Allow` to allow Aniyomi to access your storage.

4. Now you will be asked to grant Aniyomi the necessary permissions. 

    ![Aniyomi Permissions](/img/aniyomi/onboarding_3.jpg)

    Click `Grant` to grant Aniyomi the necessary permissions.

5. The onboarding process is now complete. Click `Get Started` to start using Aniyomi.



### Tracking

To track your anime and manga, you can make use of the various tracking services available in Aniyomi.

1. Click on the `More` tab at the bottom of the screen, then click on `Settings`.

    ![Aniyomi More Tab](/img/aniyomi/more_tab.jpg)

2. In the settings menu, click on `Tracking`.

3. Here, you will see a list of tracking services that you can use. Click on the service you want to use and sign in with the account for that service.




## Adding Extension Repositories

The way Aniyomi works is through the use of extensions. Extensions are like plugins that allow Aniyomi to fetch anime and manga from different sources.
For example, if you had a specific anime site, you could create an extension for it and add it to Aniyomi. This extension would then fetch anime from that site and display it in Aniyomi.

We can make use of third-party extension repositories that contain community maintained extensions. These repositories contain extensions for a variety of different sites.

We will be making use of the [Kohi Den](https://github.com/Kohi-den/extensions) repository for anime and the [Keiyoushi](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions) repository for manga.

To add the repositories, simply click the links below:

- [Kohi Den](aniyomi://add-repo?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fkohi-den%2Fextensions%2Fmain%2Findex.min.json)
- [Keiyoushi](aniyomi://add-repo?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fkeiyoushi%2Fextensions%2Frepo%2Findex.min.json)

If the links don't work, you can add the repositories manually by following the steps below:

1. Open Aniyomi and click on the `More` tab at the bottom of the screen, then click on `Settings`.

    ![Aniyomi More Tab](/img/aniyomi/more_tab.jpg)

2. In the settings menu, click on `Browse`

    ![Aniyomi Settings Menu](/img/aniyomi/settings.jpg)


3. Here, you will see `Anime extension repos` and `Manga extension repos`. 
    Depending on which repository you want to add, click on the respective section.

    ![Aniyomi Extension Repos](/img/aniyomi/browse_settings.jpg)

4. Click `+ Add` in the bottom right corner, and paste one of the following URLs in the text box:

    **Kohi Den (Anime):**
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kohi-den/extensions/main/index.min.json
    ```
    **Keiyoushi (Manga):**
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keiyoushi/extensions/repo/index.min.json
    ```

    ![Aniyomi Add Repo](/img/aniyomi/adding_repo.jpg)

5. Click `Add` to add the repository.

Now, when you go to the `Browse` > `Anime Extensions` or `Manga Extensions` section, you will see the extensions from the repositories you added.

You can start trying out different extensions and see which one works best for you.

:::tip
Due to the nature of third-party extensions, you must click on the extension to trust it. Aniyomi will not fetch data from an extension that you have not trusted.
Each time an extension is updated, you will need to trust it again.
:::

## Using Torrents

Now, I will go through how to watch anime using torrents on Aniyomi.

To see the benefits of using torrents, refer to this [torrenting guide from thewiki.moe](https://thewiki.moe/getting-started/torrenting/)
Note that, with Aniyomi, we will be streaming torrents, not downloading them.


Although Aniyomi does not currently support torrent streaming, it is still possible to use Torrentio Anime on Aniyomi through a debrid service. 
Some [forks of Aniyomi](/aniyomi/forks) do support torrent streaming, so you can use Torrentio Anime on those forks without a debrid service.

### Debrid Service

I will now go through what a debrid service is and why you may want to use one. 

**It is not required** to use a debrid service. You will need to use a [fork of Aniyomi](/aniyomi/forks) that supports torrent streaming if you do not want to use a debrid service.
You would still be able to stream torrents as long as it has enough seeders.
However, using a debrid service will provide a better experience.

#### What is a debrid service?

A debrid service is a service that allows you to generate unrestricted (up to 1gbps) download links for torrents and other files on supported hosters (It has more features that are discussed in [Debrid Services](/stremio/technical-details#debrid-services)).

It brings the following benefits:

- Using a debrid service allows you to stream torrents without the risk of receiving a notice from your ISP as you would be streaming through HTTPS
- While you are streaming something, you are not reliant on the number of seeders and can stream at up to 1gbps speeds. This makes it possible to stream some of the highest quality content available (4K, DV, HDR, Dolby Atmos, etc.) without buffering as long as your internet connection can handle it.
- If you are using a debrid service, a VPN is not required as you are streaming through HTTPS.
- You can use it for more than just Aniyomi. You can use it to download any type of file, whether that be games, software or audio. If it is a torrent or a file on a supported hoster, you can download it through your debrid service.
    :::note
    You can even use it with other apps like Stremio. You can utilise the debrid service to stream torrents on Stremio too. You can have a look at my [Stremio Guide](/stremio) for more information on how to set up a debrid service with Stremio.
    ::: 

However, the drawbacks of using a debrid service are that most do not seed the torrents and will also restrict usage to one IP address at a time.
This means that you are not contributing to the torrent and that you can only use the service in one location at a time. 
:::tip
For more details on the one IP address rule, please see [this question in the Stremio FAQ](/stremio/faq#how-does-the-one-ip-address-rule-work).
:::

There are some exceptions to this, which I discuss below.

#### Should I use a debrid service? 

The answer to this question is dependent on your personal circumstances.
If your answer is no, then you will need to use a fork of Aniyomi that supports torrent streaming.

- Whether torrenting puts you at risk of receiving a notice from your ISP
- The popularity (number of seeders) of the content you want to watch
- Whether your internet speed is sufficient to warrant a debrid service

The main reason to use a debrid service is to avoid the risks of torrenting.
As explained earlier, you are streaming through HTTPS and the debrid service essentially becomes the middle-man.
However, if you are in a country where torrenting is not an issue, then a debrid service or VPN is not needed to avoid receiving a notice from your ISP.

The next big reason is to avoid buffering.
However, whether it buffers or not depends on the type of content you are watching and your internet speed.
If the content you want to watch is popular and has a lot of seeders, then you will be able to stream it at a high quality without buffering.
However, torrents of extremely high quality content may still buffer even with a lot of seeders.

Something that is often ignored is that a debrid service cannot increase your download speeds.
If your internet speed is already slow, then a debrid service will not help you stream higher quality content.
You need to have a fast internet speed yourself to capitalise on the benefits of a debrid service.

With all that being said, if torrenting is not an issue, the best way to determine whether you need a debrid service is to try streaming without one.
You can then try watching the content you want to watch and see if it buffers at the quality you want to watch in. 
If it does, then you may want to consider using a debrid service.

#### Which debrid service do I use?

:::info
I receive a commission (free days or small amount of money) if you sign up to a debrid service through (some of) the links provided. This is at no extra cost to you and is a way to support me.
:::

There are many debrid services available to use. Here is a list of the ones supported by, currently, the only torrent addon available for Aniyomi - Torrentio Anime:

- [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/?id=9483829)
- [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/?uid=3n8qa&lang=en)
- [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/)
- [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.com/id/EY0JO)
- [Offcloud](https://offcloud.com/?=06202a3d)
- [Put.io](https://put.io/)

When choosing a Debrid service, the factors you have to consider are cost and the value you get from it which is made up of its optimality and userbase.

**TL;DR**: Most users should use Real Debrid or AllDebrid. ([Skip to the setup instructions](#setting-up-a-debrid-service))

**Cost**

</details>

All-Debrid and Debrid-Link are the cheapest debrid services, with Real Debrid closely following.


:::info
If you are unsure if this is something you want to use, you can try a free trial or a limited free plan.

- All-Debrid offer a free 7-day trial with phone number verification.
- put.io offers a $0.99 1 day trial.

Alternatively, you can use the 15 day package that most debrid services offer to test them out.
:::


**Optimality**

Optimality refers to your proximity to the service's servers. The closer you are, the faster the download speeds and thus the better the streaming experience.
The download speeds you get directly determine the quality of the stream you can watch. Make sure to carry out speed tests to determine the best service for you.
The speed tests for each debrid service can be found [here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-the-speed-tests-for-debrid-services) and on their website too.

**Userbase**

This is important as the more users a debrid service has, the more cached torrents it will have.
Cached torrents are what you rely on when streaming content on Aniyomi.

A larger userbase means more cached torrents, with Real Debrid and AllDebrid leading.
However, the other debrid services will still have a lot of popular torrents cached.
Other debrid services will still have a noticeably lower amount of cached torrents. 

**Additional Features**

Another thing to consider is the additional features that some debrid services offer.

I previously discussed some of the limitations of debrid services, namely the lack of seeding and the restriction to one IP address.
As I said before, there are some exceptions. I will now go through them.


- **IP Restrictions**:

    - Premiumize also allows several IPs. However, it does operate on a storage limitation that you may reach depending on your usage.

- **Seeding**:

    :::warning
    With the way debrid services work, debrid services will always be taking more than they are giving.

    The debrid services below will seed the torrent if it hasn't been cached already. 
    In the case that its already been cached, they may not seed it, and other users can stream this cached torrent too. 
    :::
    - Debrid-Link offers a seedbox with these limits: 600 torrents and 2.5TB of data transfer per month.
    - Premiumize will seed to a 2.0 ratio or for 72 hours. Whichever comes first.
    - put.io is similar to Premiumize but the exact numbers are dependent on your plan. Check their pricing page for more information.


**My recommendation would be Real Debrid**

#### Setting up a debrid service

I will now cover the instructions of setting up each debrid service I previously mentioned.

    One plan gives you 100GB of storage and the other 1TB. Depending on the amount and size of files you will be streaming, choose the plan that suits you best.

    I believe that the storage is not made up of the accumulated size of all the files you have downloaded, but rather the amount of files you have downloaded and stored currently.
    You can delete files to make space for new ones.

    However, I am unsure of the accuracy of this information. If you are considering put.io, then I would recommend contacting their support or looking at their FAQ.

### Installing Torrent Addons 

Now, we can go through the process of installing and configuring a torrent addon in Aniyomi.

If you have used [Stremio](/stremio/) before, you will definitely have heard about the Torrentio addon before. 

Torrentio is a Stremio addon that returns torrent results for movies and TV shows. 
For a more detailed explanation on how Torrentio works, you can read [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/19fmjlp/comment/kjlnwru/)

Torrentio Anime is an extension that uses the Torrentio stremio addon to fetch torrent results for anime only. 

At the moment, there is only one torrent addon available for Aniyomi - Torrentio Anime (and Torrentio - this would be used for movies and TV shows too, not just Anime).

I will be using the Torrentio Anime extension from the Kohi Den repository.

1. Go to the `Browse` > `Anime Extensions` section in Aniyomi, and search for `Torrentio Anime`.

    ![Aniyomi Browse Anime Extensions](/img/aniyomi/search_torrentio.jpg)

2. Click the download button to install the extension.

3. Once the extension is installed, click on the settings icon to configure the extension.

4. Then click on the settings icon again next to `Multi` to configure it.

    ![Aniyomi Torrentio Anime Settings](/img/aniyomi/torrentio_settings.jpg)

- `Debrid Provider` - Choose your debrid provider from the list.

- `Token` - Enter your debrid service's API key here if using one, otherwise leave it blank.

</details>

- `Enable/Disable Providers`:
    
    Here, you can choose the different providers that Torrentio will fetch torrents from. You can enable or disable them by clicking on them. I recommend enabling all of them for the most results.

- `Exclude Qualties/Resolutions` - You can choose to exclude certain qualities from the search results. Since we are on mobile where your phone most likely doesn't support 4K, I recommend excluding the following qualities:
    - HDR/HDR10+/Dolby Vision
    - Dolby Vision
    - 4k
    - Screener
    - CAM

- `Priority Foreign Language` - Here, you can choose the language you want your results to have. I recommmend leaving this blank.

- `Sorting`: You can choose how you want your results to be sorted. 

    - If you are using a debrid service, I recommend `By quality then size`. 
Usually, the higher the size the better the quality, so this will give you the best quality results. 

    - If you are not using a debrid service, you will want to sort `By quality then seeders`.
Without a debrid service, you are reliant on seeders, so the more seeders the better.

- `Preferred Title` - Here, you can choose the title you want your results to have. This is completely preference, but I prefer the English title.
    - Romaji - Shingei no Kyojin
    - English - Attack on Titan
    - Native - 進撃の巨人

- `Show upcoming episodes` - If enabled, this will show unaired episodes in the episode list for an anime. I recommend keeping this disabled.

- `Dubbed video Priority` - If enabled, dubbed videos will be shown first in the results. If you prefer dubbed anime, enable this.

- `Efficient Video Priority` - If enabled, videos that are more efficient to stream (x265, HEVC) will be shown first in the results. If you have a slow internet connection, or limited data, you may want to enable this.


Once you have configured the settings, restart Aniyomi to apply the changes.

:::tip
I recommend pinning the Torrentio Anime source. This is because Aniyomi will only search for sources from pinned sources, at first. 

To pin the Torrentio Anime source, click on `Browse`, then `Anime Sources`, then click on the pin icon next to `Torrentio Anime`.

## Using Aniyomi



There are 5 main sections in Aniyomi:

- Anime: This is your Anime library where you can find all the anime you have added to your library.
- Manga: This is your Manga library where you can find all the manga you have added to your library.
- Updates: Whenever the extension for the anime/manga in your library has a new episode/chapter, it will show up here.
- Browse: This is where you can browse for new anime and manga to add to your library.
- More: This is where you can find additional menus like settings, history, statistics, backups and more. 


![Aniyomi Home Screen](/img/aniyomi/app.jpg)

### Adding Anime to your Library

To add anime to your library, you can either do a global search by pressing the globe icon in the top right corner of the `Browse` tab, or you can click on a specific anime source and search for anime there.

Once you find the anime you want to add to your library, click on it to open the page for that anime.

You can then click `Add to Library` to add the anime to your library, or `Tracking` to enable your tracking services for that anime. 

You can pull down on the screen to refresh the page and check for new episodes.


### Watching Anime

To watch anime, within the page for the anime you want to watch, click on the episode you want to watch.

You will then open the player. The episode will start playing automatically.

To change servers/links, subtitles, and audio, click on the player icon with a setting cog in the top right corner of the player.
