# Debrid Media Manager

[https://debridmediamanager.com/](https://debridmediamanager.com/)

This is only for people paying for a Debrid service.
It only supports Real Debrid and AllDebrid with [TorBox support possibly coming soon](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/debrid-media-manager/pull/132).


### How to use it?

This website acts as a front-end to your debrid service.
It only supports Real Debrid and AllDebrid.
You can search for any movie or tv show on this website.

If you have a movie or show that is too niche to have cached torrents, you can search for the movie or show here by clicking the search button. 

Once you are on the page for the show or movie you can browse the available torrents.
You can also click the show x uncached. This will show torrents that have not been cached. 

For cached torrents, it will show `Instant RD/AD`.
You can directly watch the torrent through debridmediamanager by clicking look inside, then clicking `Watch`. 

For uncached torrents, it will show `DL with RD/AD`.
By clicking this, you will send a request to your debrid service to start downloading this torrent. 

If you want to watch this on Stremio, you have to ensure it is cached and added to your library (click Instant RD/AD to add it to your library). 
So for uncached, you will have to wait for the download to complete.

Then, you can either: 
- Use the debrid catalog from the Torrentio extension (you have to have this setting enabled in the Torrentio settings)
- Use [Debrid Search](/stremio/addons/debrid-search) which will provide the result when you click on the movie or show you want to watch.
:::note
Although Debrid Search provides a catalog for your debrid library, you will get an error saying `The addon providing this content has been removed` if you don't have the debrid catalog option in the Torrentio configuration enabled
:::
- use the [DMM Cast Stremio Addon](/stremio/addons/dmm-cast)
