[Annatar](https://github.com/g0ldyy/annatar) is a self hostable and fast torrent/debrid search addon. (It requires a debrid service)

It can be [selfhosted](https://github.com/g0ldyy/annatar?tab=readme-ov-file#running-locally) or [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/annatar/).

You can find a full description of Annatar on their [GitHub page](https://github.com/g0ldyy/annatar)

I will go through the setup using the free, public ElfHosted instance. If you don't want to selfhost but want more customisation, you can pay for your own instance on ElfHosted.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://annatar.elfhosted.com/configure).

You will see the following configuration page:

![Annatar Configuration](/img/stremio/annatar_configuration.png)

I will now go through each option:

- `Debrid Provider` - Choose your debrid provider, Real Debrid, AllDebrid, Premiumize and Debrid-Link are supported.

- `Debrid API Key` - Obtain your API key from your debrid provider and paste it here. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))

- `Max Results` - Here you can choose from 3, 5 or 10. This is the maximum number of results that will be displayed. I choose 10 as I want to see the maximum number of results.

- `Resolution` - You can select which resolutions you want to see. I leave all resolutions selected, however, if you have a slow internet connection or your device can't handle 4K content, you may want to deselect 4K. You can also deselect lower resolutions if you only want to see higher quality content.

- `Video Quality` - You can select the video quality you want to see. I leave all selected.

After you have configured Annatar, click `Install`. This will open Stremio and prompt you to install the addon. Click Install again and the addon will be installed.
