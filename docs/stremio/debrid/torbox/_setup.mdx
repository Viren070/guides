![Torbox Payment](/img/stremio/torbox_payment.png)
Torbox is a relatively new debrid service but it is unique in that it offers a lot more.
It offers :

- A way to seed your torrents for up to 30 days to an unlimited ratio
- Access to Usenet (Usenet is explained in more detailed [below](/stremio/setup#usenet). It is simply another way to access more content)

To set up a Torbox account, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Torbox's website](https://torbox.app/)
2. Click `Get Started For Free Now` or `LOGIN` in the top right corner to create an account.
3. Click `Don't have an account yet?` at the bottom of the page.
4. Fill in the email and password fields and click `Continue`
5. You will be sent an email to verify your email address. Click the link in the email to verify your email address.
6. You will then be taken to the Dashboard.
7. Go to the [Subscription page](https://torbox.app/subscription?referral=9ca21adb-dbcb-4fb0-9195-412a5f3519bc) and choose a package.
   :::info
   You may get an alert saying `Do you want to use this referral code? If you already have a code, this will replace it.`
   This is because the above link has a referral code in it. You will get 7 days free if you accept my referal code for
   each purchase you make.

   You may also enter this referral code manually at the bottom of the page:

   ```
   9ca21adb-dbcb-4fb0-9195-412a5f3519bc
   ```

8. Now you can choose the plan you want. You can choose to pay a subscription or a one-time payment. A yearly subscription has the best value.
   :::note
   To access Usenet and the 30 day seeding time, you need to buy the highest tier package - the `Pro` package.

9. Once you have decided on a package, click `Subscribe`
10. Then, follow the steps at the payment page to complete your purchase.
