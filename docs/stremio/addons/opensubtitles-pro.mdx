<h3>Description</h3>

A Stremio addon that provides subtitles from OpenSubtitles.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

Search for the languages you want to have subtitles for and click `Add language` to add them to your configuration. 

- `From` - This setting allows you to filter the subtitles by their uploader. You can choose to show subtitles from all, users, or trusted.
- `Include AI Translated` - This setting allows you to include subtitles that have been translated by AI.
- `MovieHash + Auto Adjustment` - This setting will use the movie hash to try and find the subtitles made for the specific file you are watching. Otherwise, it will attempt to automatically adjust the subtitles to match the video.
