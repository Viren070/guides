# Netflix to Trakt Import

[Netflix to Trakt Import](https://github.com/jensb89/Netflix-to-Trakt-Import) is a tool that allows you to transfer your Netflix watch history to Trakt.

You can use this in conjuction with the Import button on Stremio to bring your history from Trakt to Stremio. 

This can also help with couchmoney as it doesn't require you to manually mark everything as watched and you can instead just import your history from Netflix.
