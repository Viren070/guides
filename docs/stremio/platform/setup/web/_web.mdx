[Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com) is a web version of Stremio doesn't require any signup or installation.

**The following steps are for using Stremio Web only**.
If your device has a dedicated app, then you should use that instead.
You will see a separate tab if your device has a standalone app available.

```mdx-code-block
import WebIos from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/_ios.mdx";
import WebAndroid from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/_android.mdx";
import WebPc from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/_pc.mdx";
import WebVisionPro from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/_vision-pro.mdx";

<Tabs className="custom-tabs" queryString="web-platform">

    <TabItem value="ios" label="iPhone & iPad" default>

        <WebIos />


    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Vision Pro" value="vision-pro">

        <WebVisionPro />

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="PC" value="pc">

        <WebPc />
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Android" value="android">

        <WebAndroid />
    </TabItem>

##### Stremio Server

The steps below can be used to set up a stremio server that is to be used by Stremio Web.

It is completely optional and not required for most users.

On its own, Stremio Web is limited in what it can do. 
You won't be able to stream torrents, you may encounter audio issues and on some devices, you won't be able to play content within the browser.

On iOS, you are most likely using an external player. This has some limitations: - Torrent streaming is still not possible. This means **a debrid service is required** to stream torrents. - No episode progress tracking. - Addon-provided subtitles cannot be used (you can still use the embedded subtitles provided by the video file).

By using a streaming server, you can overcome these limitations.
It would mean you can play in the native web browser, stream torrents without a debrid service (though I still recommend you use a debrid service anyways) and have a better experience overall.

This is why it is recommended that you connect Stremio Web to a streaming server.

There are a few ways to set up a streaming server for Stremio Web.
You can either run it on your desktop or on your android device.
It can also be run as a docker container on any device that supports docker.
I recommend using an android device as it can be left on 24/7 more easily than a desktop.

```mdx-code-block
import ServerDesktop from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/server/_desktop.mdx";
import ServerAndroid from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/server/_android.mdx";
import ServerDocker from "@site/docs/stremio/platform/setup/web/server/_docker.mdx";


<Tabs queryString="server-device">
    <TabItem value="desktop" label="Desktop">
        <ServerDesktop />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

        <ServerAndroid />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

        <ServerDocker />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
