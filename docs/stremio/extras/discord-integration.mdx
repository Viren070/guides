# Discord Rich Presence

Want to share what you're watching on Stremio with your friends? Wait no more!.
There are two ways to do this:

### Using PreMiD

This method requires that you use Stremio Web and have the Discord desktop app installed.

1. Install [PreMiD](https://premid.app/downloads). You can use this [guide](https://docs.premid.app/en/install) to install it if needed.
2. Install the [Stremio Presence](https://premid.app/store/presences/Stremio) presence from the PreMiD store.
3. Open Discord and make sure the `Display current activity as a status message` option is enabled in the Discord settings.
4. Open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) and start watching a movie or series.
5. The presence should now show up in Discord.

### Using StremioDiscordRichPresence 


This method requires you to use the Stremio desktop app and have the Discord desktop app installed.

It uses a third-party modification to Stremio to enable Discord Rich Presence. 

You can find the instructions and source code on the [StremioDiscordRichPresence GitHub page](https://github.com/Loukious/StremioDiscordRichPresence?tab=readme-ov-file).

### Using Pimp My Stremio

There is an addon that enables Discord RPC on Pimp My Stremio. I am currently unsure if it works, I will check this later and update the guide accordingly.
TODO: Add instructions on how to install it.
