<h3>Description</h3>

StremThru Torz is a part of the suite of addons that StremThru provides. This addon provides torrent/debrid streams
from StremThru's crowdsourced torrent database as well as scraped [Debrid Media Manager](/stremio/extras/debrid-media-manager) public hashlists.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To install the StremThru Torz addon, go to the configuration page by clicking the `Configure` button above.

There, you'll be met with the list of addons/tools that StremThru provides. Scroll down to the `StremThru Torz` section and click `Configure`.

Here, you'll be able to provide your credentails for any debrid services you use. StremThru Torz supports multiple debrid services
in one installation of the addon if you have multiple debrid services. It also supports P2P torrenting if you do not use a debrid service.

Click `Store Name` and choose your debrid service from the dropdown menu. Then, click `Store Token` and paste your API key from your debrid provider. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
If you are using multiple debrid services, simply click the `+ Add` button at the bottom right to add another debrid service and repeat the process.

StremThru Torz also allows you to:

- `Only show Cached content`: This would filter out results that are not cached.

Now, simply click `Install` to open Stremio with a prompt to install the addon. If that doesn't work, you'll see a  
`Manifest URL` field where you'll be able to click the `Copy`, use the copied manifest URL to [install the addon manually](/stremio/faq#how-do-i-install-an-addon-manually).
