[Stremio-Jackett](https://github.com/aymene69/stremio-jackett) is a self hostable addon that resolves torrent links using Jackett (It does **not** require a debrid service)

Stremio-Jackett can be [selfhosted](https://github.com/aymene69/stremio-jackett#installation) or [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/stremio-jackett/).

For this guide, I will go through the setup using the free, public ElfHosted instance. If you don't want to selfhost but want more customisation, you can pay for your own instance on ElfHosted.

To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://stremio-jackett.elfhosted.com/configure)

- `Enable debrid service` - If you are using a debrid service, you can check this box. You will then see the `Debrid Information` section below.
- `Enable torrenting` - If you want to use torrents, check this box. If you are using a debrid service, there isn't a need to check this box.

If you are using a debrid service, you can fill in the `Debrid Information` section.
- `Debrid Provider` - Choose your debrid provider.
- `Debrid API Key` - Obtain your API key from your debrid provider and paste it here. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- `Metadata Provider` - You can select which metadata provider you want to use. I change this to TMDB. You will need to obtain an API key for this. If you are struggling to obtain an API key, [click here](faq#how-to-obtain-a-tmdb-api-key)
- `Sorting` - I prefer to sort by size descending. This gives me the highest sized files first. I do this because, generally, the higher the size, the higher the bitrate and the better the quality. Although, in some cases, a lower sized file can have better quality.
- `Quality Exclusion` - You can choose to exclude certain qualities. I check the boxes for `CAMs` as I don't want to watch CAMs.
- `Languages` - You can choose which languages you want to see. I only speak English so I only check English. I also check MULTi.
- `Maximum size` - I set this to 500 to see all the results.
- `Maximum results` - I set this to 100 to see all the results.
