# Addon Manager

[https://addon-manager.dontwanttos.top/](https://addon-manager.dontwanttos.top/)

Currently, the only way to re-order your Stremio addons, is to uninstall all of them and then reinstall them in the order you want. The Stremio Addon Manager solves this.

[Stremio Addon Manager](https://addon-manager.dontwanttos.top/) will allow you to manage the order of your Stremio addons without re-installing. *Including the default Cinemeta catalogues.*
