# FAQ

This FAQ will mostly repeat what has already been said but provide the answers in a more accessible form

## Debrid/VPN Questions

### Is a Debrid Service required?

No. Depending on your circumstances, Stremio and Torrentio without a Debrid service may work fine and 4K content may still stream without buffering.

However, torrenting carries a legal risk and if this is an issue for you, a debrid service is recommended.

Furthermore, torrenting relies on seeders being available constantly and you are limited by the upload seed of the seeders.
With a Debrid Service, this issue is solved as the torrent is downloaded to the Debrid services' high speed servers.
You can then stream content from their servers at high speeds. (The speed is still limited by your own internet connection)

### Do I need a VPN?

If you are using a debrid service, a VPN is NOT required.

For HTTP addons, a VPN is not required.
However, if you are using a torrent addon such as Torrentio then a VPN or a Debrid service might be required.

This depends on the laws in your country. If your country is strict on torrenting, then a VPN or a Debrid service is recommended.
Otherwise, you can use Stremio without a VPN or a Debrid service.

However, a Debrid service is usually the better option as it is usually cheaper and provides a smoother experience on Stremio and a debrid service can also be used to download other torrents.

### Can you have a recurring payment with Real Debrid?

On Real Debrid, there are no recurring payments. You will have to set a reminder to renew your subscription. 
You can always add more days to your subscription before it expires.

Other debrid providers, such as AllDebrid, do have recurring payments based on a monthly subscription.

### How do I know if I am in an optimal location for a Debrid service?

You can check the speed of your connection to the Debrid service by using the speedtest on the Debrid service's website.

You can find the speed tests [here](#where-can-i-find-the-speed-tests-for-debrid-services).

For other Debrid services, you can find the speedtest on their website.

### Can I use a Debrid service on multiple devices?

Yes. A debrid service can be used from an unlimited number of devices. 

Most debrid services will **not allow you to use the service from more than one public IP address at a time**.

This would mean that you can use the service on multiple devices within your home network but you cannot use the service on a device outside of your home network while another device is using the service at home.
You can find more details on this [below](#how-does-the-one-ip-address-rule-work).

However, there are some exceptions to this.
Torbox and Premiumize allow you to use the service from multiple IP addresses at the same time.

### How does the one IP address rule work?

Debrid services typically allow access from only one IP address at a time. 
This means you can't use the service from multiple IP addresses simultaneously.

In a network, all devices share the same public IP address, allowing multiple devices on the same network to use the service concurrently.
However, this may be limited by your internet bandwidth and speed.

If the debrid service is being used at home, it can't be used on a device outside your home network at the same time, and vice versa.

Using a VPN changes your IP address, so if you're on a VPN, others on your network can't use the Debrid service simultaneously, as it would appear as multiple IP addresses accessing the service.

### Can I use a Debrid service with a VPN?

Yes, but it is not recommended.
A debrid service is enough to protect you from legal trouble and a VPN can limit your speed.

As explained in the previous question, a VPN changes your IP address.
This means that if you are using a VPN, others on your network can't use the Debrid service simultaneously, as it would appear as multiple IP addresses accessing the service.

### Where can I find the speed tests for Debrid services?

Here, you can find the links to the speed tests for different Debrid services.
These speed tests will give you an idea of the speed you can expect when streaming through these services.

:::warning
You may need to be logged in to access these pages. 
If you get any errors attempting to access these pages, try logging in to the Debrid service first, then clicking the link again.

Do consider using my affiliate links to sign up if you haven't created an account already. 
These are available [here](setup#which-debrid-service-do-i-use).
:::

- [Real Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/speedtest)
- [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/speedtest)
- [Premiumize](https://www.premiumize.me/speedtest)
- [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.fr/webapp/speedtest)
- [put.io](https://app.put.io/settings/route)
- [Torbox](https://speedtest.torbox.app/)

For offcloud, there is no speedtest available, however you can test the speed by checking each proxy manually and attempting to download a file.
This does require you to have a premium account.

For other Debrid services, you can try to find the speed test on their website.

You can also use [SamKnows](https://www.samknows.com/realspeed) to test your own internet speed.
This will let you know if a debrid service is limiting your speed.

:::info
I only included the debrid services that were covered in my guide. However, even if I had a column for each one, this wouldn't change the table very much. 

The only row that would change is the MediaFusion addon. This is because this addon also supports PikPak and Seedr.cc which are not covered in this guide.
All other addons only support some debrid services covered in this guide.
:::

### What do I do if I encounter buffering issues with a Debrid service?

If you are encountering buffering issues with a Debrid service, you can try the following:

1. **Carry out a speed test** - Check the speed of your connection to the Debrid service. You can find the speed tests [here](#where-can-i-find-the-speed-tests-for-debrid-services).
    Make sure to carry out a speed test on your own internet connection as well to ensure that the issue is not with your own internet connection.

2. **Change the route/server** - You can try changing the route/server that you are using to connect to the Debrid service. 
    You can find the option to change the route/server in the settings of the Debrid service.

3. **Check the status of the Debrid service** - Sometimes, the Debrid service may be experiencing issues. You can check the status of the Debrid service on their website or social media.
    You can also check on r/StremioAddons to see if others are experiencing the same issue.
  

## Addon Questions

### Can I change the configuration of an addon without reinstalling it?

Yes, simply click the cogwheel/settings icon on the addon in the addons menu.
This opens the addon's configuration page with your current configuration.
You can change the settings here and click install again.

:::info
You will have to uninstall the old version of the addon as you would otherwise have two versions of the addon installed.
:::

### Where can I find more addons?

Through the Community addons tab in the Addons menu of the Stremio app or the [community hosted addon list](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/)

### Is [insert addon here] down?

Use this [website](https://status.elfhosted.com/) from ElfHosted to check the status of various addons. 
You can also check the [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/) subreddit or the [r/StremioAddons Discord](https://discord.gg/zNRf6YF) for more information.

### Is there a way to change the order of the addons without reinstalling them?

Yes. You can use the [Stremio Addon Manager](extras/addon-manager) to change the order of your addons without reinstalling them.

### How do I install an addon manually?

To install an addon manually, you will need the addon's manifest URL.

There are 3 possible ways to obtain this URL:

1. The addon's configuration page has a `Copy URL` button or a box with the URL in it.
2. The addon's configuration page will copy the URL to your clipboard automatically when you click install
3. You can right click / hold the install button and click `Copy link`

To avoid issues, when you are pasting the link replace stremio:// with https://

Now that you have the URL, you can install the addon on your device by following these steps depending on the platform you are using:

<Tabs groupId="platform" className="custom-tabs">
  	<TabItem value="web" label="Stremio Web / iOS">
		1. Go to the [Addon page on Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/#/addons).
		2. Click the ` + Add Addon` button
		3. Paste the URL into the box and click `Add` 
		4. A prompt will appear asking if you want to install the addon. Click `Install`
  	</TabItem>

	<TabItem value="app" label="Stremio Apps">

		This is for if you are using the Stremio app on a device such as Android,
		Windows, macOS etc. 
		
		1. Open the Stremio app and go to the Addons menu. 
		2. Click the search bar and paste the URL into the search bar.
		3. A prompt will appear asking if you want to install the addon. Click `Install`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### What is the difference between Torrentio and Torrentio-sh?

The [KnightCrawler addon](https://knightcrawler.elfhosted.com/configure) used to be called torrentio-sh and only supported 4 providers initially, and there was no elf hosted version.
This is because its initial goal was to be a self hostable torrentio (Hence the -sh in the name, which stood for self hosted).

As there was no public instance of torrentio, a member of the community hosted an instance of it and it still remains on the list now.

This addon is outdated and there is no reason to install it. You will find much less streams, especially for TV shows due to the limited number of providers.

The normal Torrentio addon is not listed in the addon catalog, you will have to install it from [the configuration page](https://torrentio.strem.fun/).

### What addons do I need to watch anime?

The only 2 addons you need are Torrentio and Anime Kitsu. 

Make sure the NyaaSi and AniDex providers are enabled in Torrentio.
You should also make sure that you are using the Anime Kitsu addon to get the best results.


## Stremio questions

### Will I have to repeat the setup process on all of my devices?

No. Your account and its addons are stored on Stremio's servers. 
Meaning that it is all in the cloud. 
As long as you sign in to the same account on a different device, it will sync the addons that are linked with your account and you do not need to repeat the setup process.

### My device was not listed in the supported devices list. Can I still use it?

Yes. Through [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com), any device can use Stremio as long as you log in your account.

### Can I use Stremio on my Smart TV?

Yes. Stremio will run on any android based smart TV. It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.
Stremio is also available on LG WebOS (2020+ models only) and Samsung Tizen (2019+ models only). 
You can download it from the respective app stores.

### Will Stremio automatically update?

If Stremio is installed from the Google Play Store, it will automatically update.

If Stremio was sideloaded / installed from the website, it will not automatically update. You will have to manually update it.

### Can I use Stremio on my iPhone or iPad?

Yes. Although a fully featured Stremio app is not available on iOS, you can add the Stremio Web app to your home screen.

Read the [iOS tab](setup?platform=web-ios#downloading-stremio) under the Web category for more information

### Can I use Stremio on my iPhone or iPad without a debrid service? 

Yes. You will have to set up a streaming server on your computer or android phone. 

Read the [stremio server](setup?platform=web#downloading-stremio) guide for more information.


### What streaming device should I use for Stremio?

The Chromecast 4K with Google TV, Fire TV Stick 4K, or the ONN 4K Box Pro are the best devices in terms of value for money.

The ONN is only available in America from Walmart but it is the best value so it is highly recommended.

The Amazon Fire TV Sticks are becoming more and more locked down and many have run into issues with them.
They will be moving from an Android based OS to a custom OS and this will make sideloading Stremio impossible.
However, currently, it is still a good option if you are not in America.

The Chromecast 4K with Google TV is the most customisable and offers the best experience.

However, the most powerful device you can use is the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro. 
It is the most expensive but it is the most powerful. Although it is old, it still is a good choice.
You may also consider the Fire Cube.

In my personal opinion (I recommend researching this yourself):

- the best device in terms of value for money is the ONN 4K Box Pro if you are in America or the cheapest out of the Fire Stick 4K and Chromecast 4K if you are not in America.
- the best device in terms of performance is the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro.

### Can I use Stremio on my Apple TV or Roku?

No. Stremio is not available on Apple TV or Roku.

### Can I use Stremio on my Rasberry Pi?

Yes. The Stremio team have released Stremio OS for the Rasberry Pi 4 and 5 that has Stremio pre-installed.
You can find the download link and instructions [here](https://blog.stremio.com/stremio-os-is-now-available-for-raspberry-pi-5-4/)

### How do I change the default player?

The instructions are different depending on the device you are using.
I'm not sure on the instructions for every device but they should be something similar.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="web" label="Stremio Web" default>
    1. Go to the settings menu
    2. Click on the player tab
    3. Scroll down to the advanced section and find the `Play in external player` option
    4. Click on the dropdown menu and select the player you want to use

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    1. Within the player, click on the 3 dots
    2. There should be an option saying `Watch on [player name]`
    3. Click on this and the video should open in the player you selected
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android" label="Android">
    1. Within the player, there is a button that says `Play in external player`
    2. Click this and it should show a prompt asking which player to use. 
    3. Select the player you want to use and the video should open in that player.
    <Admonition type="info">
    There is an option in settings called `Always open in external player`. You can enable this to always open videos in an external player.
    </Admonition>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Can I download a stream from Stremio?

If you are using a debrid service, then you only need to start watching the video. 
It will then show up on your debrid service's website where you can download it.

Otherwise you may also try the following:

Yes. You can download a video by clicking the 3 dots within the player and then clicking `Download this video`.

You can also use [Stremio Downloader](extras/stremio-downloader).

### Is there a watch together feature?

Although there is no official watch together feature, you can use several solutions:

- [Peario](https://peario.xyz/) is a watch together service that works with Stremio specifically.
  Scroll down to the `Bonus: Movies are better with popcorn... and friends` section of the [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/17833ms/stremio_all_you_need_to_know/) for more information.
  :::danger
  Peario simply shares the streaming link that you click on with your friends.
  This means that if you are **using a Debrid service**, your friends will count as an additional IP address and you can get your account **terminated**. (This is not the case for Premiumize)
  This has been confirmed by the developer in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/tymmesyde/peario-client/issues/67)
  :::
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) has a screen sharing feature that can be used to watch content together. 
  However, you will be limited to the quality of the stream that Discord can handle which is 720p@30fps or 4k@60fps for Nitro users.
  :::info
  You can use client modifications such as [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) or [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) to increase the quality of the stream without having to pay for Nitro
  :::
- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/) is a screen sharing service that can be used to watch content together. 
  It is not limited by the quality of the stream that Discord is limited to.

### Can I import my history from Netflix? 

Yes. You can use [Netflix-To-Trakt-Import](https://github.com/jensb89/Netflix-to-Trakt-Import) to import your Netflix history to Trakt. 
You can then import your Trakt history to Stremio.

### Is it possible to see the ratings of movies and shows on the posters?

Yes. There are services that can provide posters with ratings. 

I will go through two of these services, [RPDB](https://ratingposterdb.com/) and [aioratings](https://aioratings.com/). 

These services are databases of movie posters with ratings. They provide an API that addon developers can use to get the posters with ratings.
You will only be able to use these services with addons that support them.

While these services provide a free tier, these are limited and depending on your needs, you may want to pay for a higher tier. 

<Tabs queryString="ratings" className="custom-tabs">
<TabItem value="rpdb" label="RPDB">

To see what [RPDB](https://ratingposterdb.com/) offers, have a look at these [examples](https://ratingposterdb.com/examples/). 
The examples will show you what you get on each tier.

Other than the ratings, RPDB also offers textless posters, posters with other languages, badges (4K, REMUX, HDR etc.).
You can also get backgrounds with ratings and certifications.

Follow [these instructions](#how-do-i-obtain-a-rpdb-api-key) to obtain an API key.

<details>
<summary>What addons support RPDB?</summary>
<div>

To use RPDB, input your API Key in the configuration page for the addon, unless stated otherwise.

RPDB is supported by the following catalogue addons:

  - [Streaming Catalogs](/stremio/addons/streaming-catalogs)
  - [Cyberflix](/stremio/addons/cyberflix)
  - [Trakt.tv Addon](/stremio/extras/trakt#adding-the-trakt-lists-to-stremio)
  - [MDBList](https://1fe84bc728af-stremio-mdblist.baby-beamup.club/configure)
  - [Anime Catalogs](/stremio/addons/anime-catalogs)
  - [RPDB Catalogs](https://1fe84bc728af-rpdb.baby-beamup.club/configure)

  - [Anime Seasons](https://1fe84bc728af-anime-seasons.baby-beamup.club/configure)
  - [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.almosteffective.com/configure/)
  - It can also be used on the [Stremio Lists website](https://www.journey.co.il/stremio/) (Applies to the [Newest Movies](/stremio/addons/newest-movies), [Popular People](/stremio/addons/popular-people) and [Networks](/stremio/addons/networks) addons and any custom catalogues you create)
      - To use it on this website, you have to create an account by clicking `Register` in the top right corner. Then, click `Your Catalogs` where you can enter your RPDB API key.
</div>
</details>

You can also use it to replace the posters of Cinemeta, the default metadata and catalogue addon. 
However, this requires a paid API key. **It will not work with the free tier**.

To do this, use this [Cinemeta (with ratings)](https://cinemeta.ratingposterdb.com/) addon.

You can use the [RPDB Manager](https://manager.ratingposterdb.com/) to customise the posters. 
With the free tier, there are no customisation options.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="aioratings" label="aioratings">

[aioratings](https://aioratings.com/) has a free plan and a pro plan. 

The free plan provides IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, while the pro plan also provides ratings from Metacritic and Roger Ebert.

Currently, aioratings only has its own [Stremio aioratings addon](https://stremio.aioratings.com/) that supports it.

To use aioratings, you will need to sign up for an account on their website and obtain an API key.

Once you have the API key, you can input it into the configuration page of the aioratings addon.

### Can I use Stremio to watch local files, like on Plex or Jellyfin?

Although there is a local files addon, it is not recommended to use Stremio for this purpose.
Stremio is not designed to be a media server and it is not as good as Plex or Jellyfin for this purpose.

### Is it possible to share what I am watching on Discord? 

Yes. There are multiple ways to do this. Read the [Discord section](extras/discord-integration) for more information.

### Can I use my own subtitles?

Yes. Drag your subtitle file into the player and it should play with the video. 
You can also use the MSubtitles addon to use your own subtitles.

### Can I make my own addon for Stremio?

Yes. The [Stremio Addon SDK](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/) can be used to develop addons with Node.js.
Addons can also be developed with any other language that supports creating a HTTP server. 
Here are some [examples](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/blob/ff10a5a66ff6a592d6145baba117515041aa33ab/docs/examples.md)

### Can I use Stremio to watch Live TV?

Stremio does support live streams. However, its its interface is not designed for this and there are very few working addons.

- The [USA TV Addon](https://848b3516657c-usatv.baby-beamup.club/) can be used to watch live TV for channels in the USA.
- [MediaFusion](https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com/configure) does provide live streams and replays for sports.
- The [xtremio addon](https://xtremio.elfhosted.com/configure) can be used to stream content from your paid IPTV subscription.

Please see the [Live TV section](setup#live-tv--sports) for more information.

### Can I have my lists from Letterboxd or Simkl on Stremio?

Yes. There are addons that can be used to import your lists from these services.

### Is there a way to get recommendations based on what I have watched?

Yes. You can use Trakt to achieve this. Read the [Trakt section](extras/trakt) for more information.

### Is it possible to have Stremio automatically open on fullscreen on boot? 

Yes. For Windows, another user has created a AutoHotkey script that will automatically put Stremio in fullscreen when it is opened.

See how to do this at [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1d42tbq/comment/lvnw5sg/).
