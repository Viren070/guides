# Troubleshooting

## A movie/TV show I wanted to watch said “No streams were found”

Ensure that you followed the guide correctly. If you are sure you did this, then first ensure that there is a digital version of the movie or TV show you are trying to watch. 

If the movie or TV show you are trying to watch is still in cinemas, you will not see streams as a digital release has not come out yet. You may see CAM or Screener (a recording of the movie being played in cinema) if you have not excluded those qualities.  

Try using [Debrid Media Manager](extras#debrid-media-manager) to find the movie or TV show. If you can find it through here, you should be able to watch it through debrid media manager. If you want to watch it on Stremio, use the Debrid Search addon (linked above) to achieve this.

## Content keeps stuttering/buffering

Try enabling the hardware-accelerated decoding option in the advanced player settings. 

This could also be caused by the limitation of your streaming device. If your device is unable to handle 4K content, then it will struggle to play this. Try playing content with a smaller file size. 

Try increasing the cache size and changing the torrent profile to Ultra Fast (only if you do not use a debrid service)

## Audio plays but only black screen

This indicates that your device can’t handle that specific stream. Try choosing a different stream. 

Note that firesticks currently have an issue with playing content that has both DV and HDR10+.
