MediaFusion is a universal stremio addon that provides a variety of content (including Live TV and Sports)

Check the [features section](https://github.com/mhdzumair/MediaFusion?tab=readme-ov-file#-features) of their GitHub page to see all that the addon has to offer.

This addon can be [selfhosted](https://github.com/mhdzumair/MediaFusion?tab=readme-ov-file#-local-add-on-deployment) or [ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/app/mediafusion/).

I will go through the setup using the free, public ElfHosted instance. If you don't want to selfhost but want more customisation, you can pay for your own instance on ElfHosted.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To get started, head over to the [configuration page](https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com/configure):

- `Streaming Provider` - Here you can choose whether to use direct torrent or a debrid service or another provider. Select what you are using and then fill in the details below.
                            Mediafusion supports authorising as a device, this is simpler but you can still use the API key method if you prefer. (Struggling to find the API key? [Click here](faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))

- `Catalog Configuration` - Here you can choose which content is available to you through MediaFusion. Simply select the content you want to see. I will provide some notes on specific options below.
    - `Prowlarr Streams` - This will provide you with streams from Prowlarr. You should enable this to get more streams.
    - `Torrentio Streams` - If you already have Torrentio installed, then there is no point in enabling this as it will just provide you with the same streams.
    - `Contribution Streams` - Enabling this provide a stream on movies and shows that allow you to upload torrent files or magnet links to MediaFusion for the community.
                                You can read more about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1cwaqh8/comment/l4w1bw1/)
    - `Provider Watchlist Catalog` - This will provide a catalog displaying all the files you have watched using the provider. I leave this unchecked as it is unnecessary clutter.
    - `Show Catalogs in Stremio` - This will show the catalogues in Stremio. I leave this checked as I want to see the catalogues for the content I have enabled.

- `Streaming Preferences`
    - `Select Streaming Resolutions` - Here you can choose which resolutions you want to see. I leave all resolutions selected, however, if you have a slow internet connection or your device can't handle 4K content, you may want to deselect 4K.
    - `Set File Size Filter` - Here you can use a max file size. I leave this at the end for an unlimited file size as I want to see all the streams available.
    - `Select & Arrange Sorting Priority` - Here you can choose the order in which the streams are displayed. I choose `Cached`, `Quality`, `Size` - in that order. If you are not using a debrid service, then do `Resolution` and `Seeders`. This is because without a debrid service you are reliant on the number of seeders. However, with a debrid service the number of seeders is irrelevant to you.
    - `Max Streams per Resolution` - Here you can choose the maximum number of streams per resolution. I set this to a large number like 50 as I want to see a high number of the streams available.
    - `Torrent Stream Display option` - Here you can choose how the torrent streams are displayed. I choose `Show parsed data`. Although there is a small chance that the parsed data is incorrect, it is usually correct and it is easier to read than the other options.

Now that MediaFusion has been configured, click `Install`. This will open Stremio and prompt you to install the addon. Click Install again and the addon will be installed.

You can also click `Share Installation URL` and copy the URL into either the Stremio addon search bar or the add addon menu on Stremio Web.
