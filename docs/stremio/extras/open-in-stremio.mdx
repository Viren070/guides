# Open in Stremio

This is a browser extension that aims to improve the integration between Stremio and other websites.

It has many features:

- Adds a button that opens the movie or show in Stremio to sites like IMDb, Trakt, Letterboxd, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic.
- Allows you to search highlighted text on any page in Stremio

You can also create lists using the extension from:

- reddit posts (on r/MovieSuggestions, r/televisionsuggestions, r/Letterboxd).
- IMDB search results

Then you can also use [their tool that converts lists to catalogues](https://www.journey.co.il/stremio/) to have these lists show up in Stremio.
