You can also use it to replace the posters of Cinemeta, the default metadata and catalogue addon.
However, this requires a paid API key. **It will not work with the free tier**.

To do this, use this [Cinemeta (with ratings)](https://cinemeta.ratingposterdb.com/) addon.

You can use the [RPDB Manager](https://manager.ratingposterdb.com/) to customise the posters.
With the free tier, there are no customisation options.
