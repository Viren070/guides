# Troubleshooting

## A movie/TV show I wanted to watch said “No streams were found”

Ensure that you followed the guide correctly. If you are sure you did this, then first ensure that there is a digital version of the movie or TV show you are trying to watch. 

If the movie or TV show you are trying to watch is still in cinemas, you will not see streams as a digital release has not come out yet. You may see CAM or Screener (a recording of the movie being played in cinema) if you have not excluded those qualities.  

Try using [Debrid Media Manager](extras#debrid-media-manager) to find the movie or TV show. If you can find it through here, you should be able to watch it through debrid media manager. If you want to watch it on Stremio, use the Debrid Search addon (linked above) to achieve this.

## Content keeps stuttering/buffering

Try enabling the hardware-accelerated decoding option in the advanced player settings. 

This could also be caused by the limitation of your streaming device. If your device is unable to handle 4K content, then it will struggle to play this. Try playing content with a smaller file size. 

Try increasing the cache size and changing the torrent profile to Ultra Fast (only if you do not use a debrid service)

If you think you have a good internet speed and are using a debrid service, then check the debrid service's website to see if they are having issues. 
Perform the speedtest on your debrid service's website to see if it is your connection to the debrid service that is the issue.

## Access Denied when trying to watch a movie/TV show on a debrid service
Check that your your debrid subscription hasn't expired.

If it hasn't, then check the debrid service's website to see if they are having issues.

If they aren't having issues, refresh your API token and reconfigure your addons that use the debrid service.

## Audio plays but only black screen

This indicates that your device can't handle that specific stream. Try choosing a different stream. 

Note that firesticks currently have an issue with playing content that has both DV and HDR10+.

## An addon is not working  
Check this [status page from ElfHosted](https://status.elfhosted.com/) or recent posts from [r/StremioAddons](https://reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/) to see if the addon is down. 

If the addon is experiencing issues, then you will have to wait for the addon developer to fix it.

Otherwise, try reinstalling the addon. If the addon depends on a debrid service and the error you get is related to the debrid service, then refresh your API token and reconfigure the addon with the new token.



## Subtitles not appearing correctly
This could be because the subtitles are SSA subtitles. Stremio's default player, ExoPlayer, does not support these subtitles. You can use an external player such as Vimu Player to fix this.
