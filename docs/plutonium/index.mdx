# Plutonium

This guide will show you how to setup Plutonium on your Windows device. Plutonium allows you to play Call of Duty: Black Ops I, II and World at War. 

You will be able to play these games for **free**.

## What is it 

Plutonium offers a unique Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, Modern Warfare 3 & World at War experience, complete with dedicated servers, mod support, and much much more. The entire modification is provided for **free** and it supports **pirated copies** too.

(It also supports [Guitar Hero 3 (III)](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/29272/plutonium-gh3-ghwt) and [007 - Quantam of Solace (7)](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/35403/plutonium-quantum-of-solace) that came about as April Fools that appeared to hint at Black Ops 3 / T7) 

This guide will cover the instructions for installing T4, T5 and T6. For IW5, please see the [official docs](https://plutonium.pw/docs/install/#iw5-modern-warfare-3)
