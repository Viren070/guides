To run the Stremio Server as a docker container, you will first need to have Docker installed on your system.
You can find instructions on how to install Docker on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once you have Docker installed, you can run the Stremio Server container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name stremio-server \
    -p 11470:11470 \
    -p 12470:12470 \
    stremio/server:latest
```

Or if you prefer to use Docker Compose, you can create a `compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  stremio-server:
    image: stremio/server:latest
    container_name: stremio-server
    ports:
      - "11470:11470"
      - "12470:12470"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

and start the compose project with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the Stremio Server in a detached mode, letting you access it at http://localhost:11470 (http) and http://localhost:12470 (https).
