Welcome to a collection of comprehensive guides on various software. 
This website contains guides on software that I personally use and have found useful.  

The guides are split into categories, which can be found in the sidebar, and also below:

- <Link to="/category/gaming">Gaming</Link>
- <Link to="/category/streaming">Streaming</Link>

:::note
If you see the ‚è≥ icon next to a guide, it means that the guide is still in progress.
