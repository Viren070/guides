# FAQ

This FAQ will mostly repeat what has already been said but provide the answers in a more accessible form 

## Is a Debrid Service required?

No. Depending on your circumstances, Stremio and Torrentio without a Debrid service may work fine and 4K content may still stream without buffering. However, torrenting carries a legal risk and if this is an issue for you, a debrid service is recommended. Furthermore, torrenting relies on seeders being available constantly and you are limited by the upload seed of the seeders. With a Debrid Service, this issue is solved as the torrent is downloaded to the Debrid services’ high speed servers. You can then stream content from their servers at high speeds. (The speed is still limited by your own internet connection)

## Do I need a VPN?

If you are using a debrid service, a VPN is NOT required. 

If you are not, it depends on the country you are living in. If your country is strict on piracy, then a VPN is recommended as you may get notices from your ISP otherwise.

If your country is strict on piracy, it is recommended that you pay for a debrid service, as it is often cheaper than a VPN, and the experience on Stremio with a debrid service is much better than a VPN.

## Will I have to repeat the setup process on all of my devices?

No. Your account and its addons are stored on Stremio’s servers. Meaning that it is all in the cloud. As long as you sign in to the same account on a different device, it will sync the addons that are linked with your account and you do not need to repeat the setup process.

## My device was not listed in the supported devices list. Can I still use it?

Yes. Through [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com), any device can use Stremio as long as you log in your account.

## What is the best device to use Stremio on?
The NVIDIA Shield TV Pro is the best choice. However, the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Chromecast with Google TV 4K are also good options and they are much cheaper than the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro and regularly go on sale.

## Can I use Stremio on my Smart TV?
Yes. Stremio will run on any android based smart TV. It can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. 
Stremio is also available on LG WebOS (2020+ models only) and Samsung Tizen (2019+ models only). You can download it from the respective app stores.

## Can I use Stremio on my iPhone or iPad?
Yes. Although a fully featured Stremio app is not available on iOS, you can add the Stremio Web app to your home screen. You will need to set an external player such as Outplayer or VLC. Follow this [blog post from Stremio](https://blog.stremio.com/using-stremio-web-on-iphone-ipad/) for more information.
:::info
Keep in mind that the Stremio Web app on iOS is unable to handle torrent playback. For this reason, you will have to use HTTP addons or use a Debrid service to stream torrent files through HTTP.

## How do I change the default player?
The instructions are different depending on the device you are using. I'm not sure on the instructions for every device but they should be something similar.

## Is Torrentio down?
Use this [website](https://status.elfhosted.com/) from ElfHosted to check the status of Torrentio.

## Can I use my own subtitles?
Yes. Drag your subtitle file into the player and it should play with the video. You can also use the MSubtitles addon to use your own subtitles.

## Can I change the configuration of an addon without reinstalling it?
Yes, simply click the cogwheel/settings icon on the addon in the addons menu. This opens the addon's configuration page with your current configuration. You can change the settings here and click install again.
:::info
You will have to uninstall the old version of the addon as you would otherwise have two versions of the addon installed.

## Can I make my own addon for Stremio?
Yes. The [Stremio Addon SDK](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/) can be used to develop addons with Node.js. 
Addons can also be developed with any other language that supports creating a HTTP server. Here are some [examples](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-addon-sdk/blob/ff10a5a66ff6a592d6145baba117515041aa33ab/docs/examples.md)

## Can I use Stremio to watch Live TV?

Stremio was not designed with Live TV in mind, so its interface for such things is less than ideal. However, MediaFusion does provide live streams. The [xtremio addon](https://xtremio.elfhosted.com/configure) can be used to stream content from your paid IPTV subscription. However, as mentioned before, the interface is not designed for this. I suggest that you try it out and if its not for you, then stick to an app designed for IPTV content or other apps that provide Live TV.

## Where can I find more addons?

Through the Community addons tab in the Addons menu of the Stremio app or the [community hosted addon list](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/)
