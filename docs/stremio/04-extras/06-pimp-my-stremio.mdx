:::warning 
Pimp My Stremio (PMS) has not been updated since 2020
:::
Pimp My Stremio is a local addon manager for Stremio. The addons available through PMS have higher capabilities than the normal addons. 
You can find a list of addons [here](https://github.com/sungshon/PimpMyStremio/blob/master/src/addonsList.json).

Read more about it on [their GitHub](https://github.com/sungshon/PimpMyStremio). There is a user guide on that page.

Although there is no android package for this, it is possible to use Termux to get it running. Here is a [guide](https://gist.github.com/sleeyax/e9635eb352a4fcdf94194f763d743689) that explains how to do so.
