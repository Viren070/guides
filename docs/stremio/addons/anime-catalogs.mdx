<h3>Description</h3>

This addon provides catalogs for anime from: MyAnimeList, AniDB, AniList, Kitsu.
It also supports filtering by dubbed and supports RPDB for ratings on posters.

This addon is similar to the [Kitsu](/stremio/addons/anime-kitsu) addon but provides a lot more catalogues from different sources (AniList, Kitsu, MyAnimeList, AniDB)

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To get started, head to the [Anime Catalogs configuration page](https://1fe84bc728af-stremio-anime-catalogs.baby-beamup.club/configure). Now, you can configure the following settings:

1. Catalog settings:

   - `Show only dubbed content` - If you want to see only dubbed content, enable this.
   - `Ratings on Posters` - This setting controls whether ratings are shown on the posters. You will need to provide an RPDB API key for this to work. ([How do I obtain an RPDB key?](/stremio/faq#how-do-i-obtain-a-rpdb-api-key))

2. Choose Catalogs: Select the catalogues that you want to see on your homepage.
3. Click Install and then when the Stremio app opens with a prompt asking to install, click Install again.
