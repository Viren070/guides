## Addon Manager

[https://addon-manager.dontwanttos.top/](https://addon-manager.dontwanttos.top/)

Currently, the only way to re-order your Stremio addons, is to uninstall all of them and then reinstall them in the order you want. The Stremio Addon Manager solves this.

[Stremio Addon Manager](https://addon-manager.dontwanttos.top/) will allow you to manage the order of your Stremio addons without re-installing. *Including the default Cinemeta catalogues.* 

## Debrid Media Manager

[https://debridmediamanager.com/](https://debridmediamanager.com/)

This is only for people paying for a Debrid service. It only supports Real Debrid and AllDebrid. You can still use it with other debrid services to find the torrent and then manually add it to your debrid service.

### How to use it?

This website acts as a front-end to your debrid service. You can search for any movie or tv show on this website.

If you have a movie or show that is too niche to have cached torrents, you can search for the movie or show here by clicking the search button. 

Once you are on the page for the show or movie you can browse the available torrents. You can also click the show x uncached. This will show torrents that have not been cached. 

For cached torrents, it will show `Instant RD/AD`. You can directly watch the torrent through debridmediamanager by clicking look inside, then clicking `Watch`. 

For uncached torrents, it will show `DL with RD/AD`. By clicking this, you will send a request to your debrid service to start downloading this torrent. 
:::info
If you are using a different debrid provider, you can click `Get magnet` and then go to your debrid services' website and paste the magnet link into their downloader.
:::

If you want to watch this on Stremio, you have to ensure it is cached first. So for uncached, you will have to wait for the download to complete.

Then, you can either: 
- Use the debrid catalog from the Torrentio extension (you have to have this setting enabled in the Torrentio settings)
- Use [Debrid Search](https://github.com/MrMonkey42/stremio-addon-debrid-search) which will provide the debrid link when you click on the movie or show you want to watch.
:::note
Although Debrid Search provides a catalog for your debrid library, you will get an error saying `The addon providing this content has been removed` if you don't have the debrid catalog option in the Torrentio configuration enabled
:::
- use the [Debrid Media Manager Stremio Addon](https://debridmediamanager.com/stremio)

## Pimp My Stremio

Pimp My Stremio is a local addon manager for Stremio. It provides more addons that may not be available on Stremio's own addon list. Please note that this has not been updated in more than 4 years. You can find a list of addons [here](https://github.com/sungshon/PimpMyStremio/blob/master/src/addonsList.json).

Read more about it on [their GitHub](https://github.com/sungshon/PimpMyStremio). There is a user guide on that page.

Although there is no android package for this, it is possible to use Termux to get it running. Here is a [guide](https://gist.github.com/sleeyax/e9635eb352a4fcdf94194f763d743689) that explains how to do so.

## Stremio downloader

[Stremio Downloader](https://github.com/BurningSands70/stremio-downloader) is a desktop application that allows you to download streams that you are watching through Stremio to your device. 

You can also download a video by clicking the 3 dots within the player and then clicking `Download this video`

If you want to download streams on android, read this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/ekwj5x/how_to_download_moviesseries_on_android/).

## Discord Rich Presence
Want to share what you're watching on Stremio with your friends? Wait no more!. 
There are two ways to do this:
### Using PreMiD
:::info
This method requires that you use [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) and have the Discord desktop client installed.
:::
1. Install [PreMiD](https://premid.app/downloads). You can use this [guide](https://docs.premid.app/en/install) to install it if needed.
2. Install the [Stremio Presence](https://premid.app/store/presences/Stremio) presence from the PreMiD store.
3. Open Discord and make sure the `Display current activity as a status message` option is enabled in the Discord settings.
4. Open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) and start watching a movie or series.
5. The presence should now show up in Discord.
### Using Pimp My Stremio
There is an addon that enables Discord RPC on Pimp My Stremio. I am currently unsure if it works, I will check this later and update the guide accordingly.
TODO: Add instructions on how to install it.
