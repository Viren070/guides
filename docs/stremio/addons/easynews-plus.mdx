The Easynews Plus addon was developed for various different reasons. 
You can read more about why it was developed on its [announcement post on r/StremioAddons](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1ehrrdg/new_addon_easynews/).

Same as the original Easynews addon, Easynews Plus requires an Easynews account to work.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

To configure and install the Easynews Plus addon:

1. Go to the [configuration page](https://b89262c192b0-stremio-easynews-addon.baby-beamup.club/configure).
2. Enter your Easynews username and password.
3. Unlike the original Easynews addon, this addon has some configuration options, let me explain them:
    - You can choose to sort the results by 3 factors. The order in which you set the 3 factors will be the order in which the results are sorted. 
    - Your 1st sort will be the primary sort, your 2nd sort will be the secondary sort, and your 3rd sort will be the tertiary sort.
    - I would recommend leaving the sorts as the default settings, but you can change them if you want.
4. Click `Install`.
