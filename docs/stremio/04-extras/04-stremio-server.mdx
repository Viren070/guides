# Stremio Streaming Server

On its own, Stremio Web is limited in what it can do. 
You won't be able to stream torrents, you may encounter audio issues and on some devices, you won't be able to play content within the browser.

On iOS, you are most likely using an external player. This has some limitations: 
    - Torrent streaming is still not possible. This means **a debrid service is required** to stream torrents.
    - No episode progress tracking. 
    - Addon-provided subtitles cannot be used (you can still use the embedded subtitles provided by the video file).

By using a streaming server, you can overcome these limitations.
It would mean you can play in the native web browser, stream torrents without a debrid service (though I still recommend you use a debrid service anyways) and have a better experience overall.

This is why it is recommended that you connect Stremio Web to a streaming server. 

There are a few ways to set up a streaming server for Stremio Web. 
You can either run it on your desktop or on your android device.
I recommend using an android device as it can be left on 24/7 more easily than a desktop.


<Tabs className="custom-tabs" queryString="device">
    <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

        1. Ensure the [Stremio app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stremio.one) is installed on your android device. 
        2. Ensure it has the notifications permission
        3. Open the app and go to settings and scroll down to the Streaming Server section.
        4. You should set the cache size to 10GB and torrent profile to Ultra Fast or Fast depending on your internet speed..

            ![stremio settings](../img/stremio_android_server_settings.jpg)

        5. Below that, you will see the `Performance & Stability` section. Check the `Run as foreground service` option. 

            ![stremio settings](../img/stremio_android_performance_settings.jpg)
        6. You should now see a notification in your notification bar. This means the server is running.

            ![stremio notification](../img/stremio_android_server_notification.jpg)

        You can now access this server from the android device only.
        To access it from other devices within your network, follow the remaining steps: 

        7. Open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) on the same android device that is running the server.
        8. Go to settings and scroll down to the Streaming section 
        9. You should see the following options:

            ![stremio web settings](../img/stremio_android_web_streaming_settings.jpg)

        10. Set the Streaming HTTPS endpoint to your local IP address (this option should appear as an option in the dropdown).
        11. Copy the Remote URL and send it to your other device.
        12. On your other device now, open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) and go to settings.
        13. Go to the Streaming section and paste the Remote URL into the `Url` field. 


    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="desktop" label="Desktop">
        You can either use a standalone server with the Stremio Service or use the server that is built-in to the desktop application. 
        If you are planning on using Stremio Web only, then I recommend using the standalone server.

        To get started, first ensure that one of the two is downloaded and installed .

        1. Download the standalone [Stremio Service](https://www.stremio.com/download-service) or the [Stremio Desktop](https://www.stremio.com/download) application.
        2. Run the setup and then launch the application. 
        <Admonition type="note">
        If you are using Stremio Service, you can see if it is running by checking the system tray.
        </Admonition>
        3. Open [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/) 
        4. Go to Settings
        5. Click on the Streaming section, you should see this: 

                ![stremio service settings](../img/stremio_service_settings.png)
            
            :::tip 
            If it shows the Status as error, try disabling any adblockers/tracking blockers you have enabled.
            On Brave, it will not work without disabling Brave Shields.

            You may need to also add an exception for the Stremio service in your firewall settings.
            :::

        6. The Stremio service has now been correctly set up. However, you can only access it on the same device.
        To access it from another device (in the same network) follow the next steps:

        7. Set the Streaming HTTPS endpoint to your local IP address (this option should appear as a dropdown).
        8. Then copy the Remote URL and paste it into your other device's Stremio settings for the streaming server URL.

        The Stremio service is now set up and can be accessed from another device.
