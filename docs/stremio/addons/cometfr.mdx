<h3>Description</h3>

This is an instance of the Comet addon with French indexers. It is a torrent/debrid search add-on that provides fast and reliable streams for Stremio users.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

- `Indexers` - Leave all indexers selected to get the most results.
- `Language` - Choose which language you want your results to have. I leave the following selected: Multi and English. You can select more if you are going to watch content in other languages (e.g. japanese for anime)
- `Resolutions` - Choose which resolutions you want your results to have. I leave all of them selected to obtain the most results.
- `Max Results` - The maximum number of results to display. I set this to 20 so I don't have as many results to scroll through. You can leave it at 0 to display all results.
- `Max Size` - The maximum size of the torrent to display. I leave this at 0. If your internet is slow or your device is incapable of streaming large files, you can set a lower maximum size here.
- `Debrid Service` - Choose your debrid service.
- `Debrid API Key` - Obtain your API key from your debrid provider and paste it here. (Struggling to find your API key? [Click here](/stremio/faq#where-can-i-find-my-debrid-api-key))
- **Advanced Settings**:
    - `Result Format` - Choose the information you want to see in the results. I leave all of them selected.

Then either click `Install` to open Stremio with a prompt to install the addon or click `Copy Link` to copy the addon URL to paste into Stremio manually.
